Hedron Kerdos
* Hedron_Quest
:: Tell Hedron his mother is safe: 300 xp
** 1 - mentioned
** 2 - in-progress: We saved Hedron's mother from a small pack of goblins that had entered her home.  She was more hysterical than grateful for our efforts and accused us of being robbers - small thanks indeed for saving her life.
** 3 - in-progress: It wasn't until we mentioned Hedron's ship, the Wicked Wench, by name that the old woman we saved ceased her howling and reluctantly admitted we might be telling the truth about us coming to help her.  She told us to go back to Hedron and tell him she was safe.  Oddly enough, Firtha mentioned that she was blind, which is strange, because she seemed to see us quite clearly.
** 4 - achieved

** 5 - botched

:: Get Iron Collar mercenary band to report to duty for Shawford: 900 xp
** ? - achieved, provoke fight: With a choice turn of phrase, we managed to provoke the Iron Collar mercenaries into letting us make an example of them.  I doubt Crawford will have any more problems with any other companies on the Palisade after they hear about what happened at the Salty Dog.
*** AddXPVar("Level_2_Easy",11503)  // You are about to lay down the law in Targos.

AR1107 - Koluhm's House
Koluhm Bonecutter
* Dead_Goblin_Quest multiple
:: Get goblin's information from Koluhm (untranslated note): 450 xp
** Dead_Goblin_Quest==2: We spoke to Koluhm Bonecutter, and he couldn't give us a translation of what the dead goblin he was questioning said, so we asked him to write down what he could and have it sent to Shawford at the Palisade.  Hopefully, someone there can make some sense of it.
*** AddXPVar("Level_2_Easy",9748)  // You have asked Koluhm to send the goblin's words to the Palisade.

:: Translate a few of the rantings in the goblin's note: 450 xp
** Dead_Goblin_Quest==5: We spoke to Koluhm Bonecutter, and he couldn't give us a translation of what the dead goblin he was questioning, so we asked him to tell us what it was saying, and we were able to translate some of it.  It sounds like the goblin tribe attacking Targos is only one of many tribes in the region - that's not good news.
*** AddXPVar("Level_2_Easy",9747)  // You have translated a bit of the dead goblin's rantings.

:: Translate some of the rantings in the goblin's note: 600 xp
** Dead_Goblin_Quest == 4 - achieved: We spoke to Koluhm Bonecutter, and he couldn't give us a translation of what the dead goblin he was questioning, so we asked him to tell us what it was saying, and we were able to translate some of it.  It sounds like the goblin tribe attacking Targos is only one of many tribes in the region - that's not good news.
*** AddXPVar("Level_2_Average",9745)  // You have translated some of the dead goblin's rantings.

:: Translate all of the rantings in the goblin's note: 900 xp
** Dead_Goblin_Quest == 3 - achieved: We spoke to Koluhm Bonecutter, and while he couldn't give tell us what the dead goblin he was questioning, we were able to translate for him, and we think we understood most of what it was saying.  It sounds like we should expect a three-pronged assault led by three different goblin leaders, and their attack was meant to coincide with the attack on the docks, so the Palisade could be in jeopardy right now.
*** AddXPVar("Level_2_Hard",9737)  // You have translated the dead goblin's rantings.

* Exposed_Bottle
:: Expose Koluhm's attempts to cheat Cahl-Hyred: 450 xp
** 1 - achieved: We confronted Koluhm on the real use of the ghost-touched bottle he gave to Cahl-Hyred.  It seems he didn't know it was ghost-touched, and he told us that we might make use of it by capturing the tears of the spirit in the Weeping Widow and taking them to the enchantress Elytharra, Lord Ulbrec's wife.
*** AddXPVar("Level_2_Easy",9749)  // You have exposed Koluhm's attempt to cheat Cahl-Hyred... and revealed that Koluhm only cheated HIMSELF.  The irony!

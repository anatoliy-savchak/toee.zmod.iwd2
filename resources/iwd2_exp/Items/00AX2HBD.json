    "Text": "The gargantuan throwing axe known as Big Death is an orcish weapon through and through.  Carried to the final battle of the Hand of Seldarine by the hulking orc warlord Yellow-Toothed Grubrun Foul-Tusks, Big Death had its origins in an ogre mercenary's two-handed battle-axe.  After a particular vicious raid on a dwarven mining settlement, Grubrun spied the axe lodged in the skull of a dead dwarven marshal.  It seems that an ogre mercenary had impaled himself upon the marshal's spear in a careless charge, but his last act had been to nearly cleave his killer's head in twain and, in trying to wrench the axe free for a second blow, shattering the haft before expiring in a bloody heap.\r\n\r\nPrying the huge, black cold-iron blade from the base of the dwarf's skull, Grubrun returned to his fortress at Nab-Nurog and had his shaman set to enchanting it.  Not having considered fixing the shaft and finding it too heavy and awkward to use in melee, Grubrun deigned to use the weapon as a throwing axe and demanded that it be ensorcelled to return to his hands after being hurled.  The warlord found great delight in heaving the enormous weapon about, roaring with glee as Big Death came careening back to him, gleaming and gore-spattered, after lopping some poor enemy in two at the waist.\r\n\r\nGrubrun Foul-Tusks finally met his end at the final battle of the Hand where he threw Big Death at the elven weapon master Kaylessa; she deftly sidestepped the flying weapon, darted forward, and ran her own blade through the empty-handed orc's belly.  Kaylessa was said to have then coolly ducked as Grubrun's own axe came whirling back at him and cleanly severed his head, rotten yellow tusks and all.\r\n\r\nBig Death is an especially large axe - almost ridiculously so - and is only identifiable as a throwing weapon because its short haft and the manner in which it's weighted.  In fact, the axe is so massive that it cannot be thrown with a single hand, requiring the wielder to grip it with both hands and hurl it sidelong with the strength of their entire body.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nDamage:  1d10 + 1\r\nAttack Bonus:  +1 \r\nEnchantment:  +1\r\nDamage Type:  Missile (piercing)\r\nDamage Type: Melee (slashing)\r\nSpecial:\r\n  Doom-Edged: 1d6 additional slashing damage\r\n  Returning: returns to wielder's hand after being thrown\r\nWeight: 10 lb.\r\nRequired Feat:  Martial Weapon, Axe\r\nType:  Two-handed",

      "Text": "The gargantuan throwing axe known as Big Death is an orcish weapon through and through.  Carried to the final battle of the Hand of Seldarine by the hulking orc warlord Yellow-Toothed Grubrun Foul-Tusks, Big Death had its origins in an ogre mercenary's two-handed battle-axe.  After a particular vicious raid on a dwarven mining settlement, Grubrun spied the axe lodged in the skull of a dead dwarven marshal.  It seems that an ogre mercenary had impaled himself upon the marshal's spear in a careless charge, but his last act had been to nearly cleave his killer's head in twain and, in trying to wrench the axe free for a second blow, shattering the haft before expiring in a bloody heap.\r\n\r\nPrying the huge, black cold-iron blade from the base of the dwarf's skull, Grubrun returned to his fortress at Nab-Nurog and had his shaman set to enchanting it.  Not having considered fixing the shaft and finding it too heavy and awkward to use in melee, Grubrun deigned to use the weapon as a throwing axe and demanded that it be ensorcelled to return to his hands after being hurled.  The warlord found great delight in heaving the enormous weapon about, roaring with glee as Big Death came careening back to him, gleaming and gore-spattered, after lopping some poor enemy in two at the waist.\r\n\r\nGrubrun Foul-Tusks finally met his end at the final battle of the Hand where he threw Big Death at the elven weapon master Kaylessa; she deftly sidestepped the flying weapon, darted forward, and ran her own blade through the empty-handed orc's belly.  Kaylessa was said to have then coolly ducked as Grubrun's own axe came whirling back at him and cleanly severed his head, rotten yellow tusks and all.\r\n\r\nBig Death is an especially large axe - almost ridiculously so - and is only identifiable as a throwing weapon because its short haft and the manner in which it's weighted.  In fact, the axe is so massive that it cannot be thrown with a single hand, requiring the wielder to grip it with both hands and hurl it sidelong with the strength of their entire body.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nDamage:  1d10 + 1\r\nAttack Bonus:  +1 \r\nEnchantment:  +1\r\nDamage Type:  Missile (piercing)\r\nDamage Type: Melee (slashing)\r\nSpecial:\r\n  Doom-Edged: 1d6 additional slashing damage\r\n  Returning: returns to wielder's hand after being thrown\r\nWeight: 10 lb.\r\nRequired Feat:  Martial Weapon, Axe\r\nType:  Two-handed",

Born in Sembia and raised in a musical family, Pellon Kay never took his performances seriously.  Kay made dozens of enemies everywhere he went because of his acidic wit and appetite for confrontation.  Sages believe that Milil frowned upon Pellon's antics, but that Talos found Pellon's attitude to be quite amusing.  The avatar of Talos watched Pellon start a fight with over twenty men in a bar one night.  As a gift for such destructive entertainment, Talos touched the lute that was laying next to Pellon's unconscious body.  After that night, Pellon discovered that he could make men go berserk just by playing his lute in their direction.  He took great delight in setting mercenaries and sailors against each other for several weeks.  Eventually, Pellon Kay was laid low by a grim-featured warrior with a crossbow who didn't let Pellon get close enough to employ his magical lute.  The unknown warrior threw the lute into the Sea of Fallen Stars.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nCan cast the spell Dire Charm once per day\r\n\r\nWeight:  2 lb.",

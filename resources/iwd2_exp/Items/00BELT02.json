    "Text": "This magical bag appears to be a common cloth sack of about 2 feet by 4 feet size.  It was left in Icewind Dale by a nameless, wandering mercenary who'd grown tired of hearing that his kind wasn't wanted there.  Seemingly loathed by all and lonely as one can be, the mercenary was said to have suddenly stood up from his seat in a Targos tavern, heaved a forlorn sigh, and wandered off, the nondescript sack seemingly abandoned beneath his chair.  Its magical properties may well have remained forever undiscovered but for a single rat that crept inside to nibble on some iron rations.  The rat was soon followed by a curious, snuffling cat, which was in turn followed by three of the proprietor's barking hounds.  The proprietor up-ended the apparently lifeless sack and, much to the tavern patrons' amazement, the lot of them came tumbling out in a noisy bundle of fur and gnashing teeth.\r\n\r\nWhen the tavern was eventually destroyed in an out-of-control cooking-oil fire, the Mercenary's Sack was sold to a passing merchant to refinance its reconstruction.\r\n\r\nThe Mercenary's Sack opens into a nondimensional space, and its inside is larger than its outside dimensions. Regardless of what is put into this item, the bag always weighs a fixed amount.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nWeight: 5 lb.",

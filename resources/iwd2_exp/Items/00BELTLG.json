    "Text": "This belt of woven hair is a curious belt, and it is woven from a mix of red dwarven hair and verbeeg giant hair.  It was originally worn as a substitute by the \"Little Giant,\" Hohn Burninghair, an ill-tempered dwarf who swore to kill a hundred giants after several raids by greedy verbeeg wiped out much of his caravan trade from Upper Dorn's Deep.  Soon after his proclamation, the Little Giant went in search of verbeeg camps, fighting them one after the other, until he came across the Temple of the Forgotten God in the mountains bordering Kuldahar.  It was said that he was brought into the Temple, and rather than risk more bloodshed, the priests agreed to reign in the verbeeg patrols from around Dorn's Deep and made reparations for the stolen goods.  Somewhat mollified, Burninghair left his woven belt in the hands of the Temple and swore peace with the verbeeg provided they kept their end of the bargain.  When the Temple was ransacked many years later, the strange belt was carried off by the attackers and lost in the North. \r\n\r\nThe Little Giant belt grants the wearer tremendous strength, most likely as a side effect of the giant hair woven into the belt and the great anger that ran deep in Burninghair's heart.  It is said that Burninghair's original belt that predated the Little Giant was much more powerful, but he lost it while pursuing a fleeing verbeeg across a river - apparently, the verbeeg was attempting to carry off one of the Burninghair's ponies.  Furious over the loss of his original belt, Burninghair simply added its loss to the list of crimes the verbeeg would pay for. \r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nSpecial:\r\n Strength: +4\r\nWeight: 2 lb.\r\n",

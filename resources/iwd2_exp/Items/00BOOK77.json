    "Text": "Ancient Lore on Labelas Enoreth\r\nBy Master E. L. Boyd\r\n\r\n  Labelas Enoreth is the elven god of longevity and time.  At the creation of the Fair Folk, Labelas blessed the elves with long lifespans and decreed that their appearances would not be marked by the passage of time.  The lifegiver cooperates with Sehanine in overseeing the lifespan of elves and their growth away from and beyond the mortal realms.  He measures the lives of the Fair Folk and decrees when they should be ended, allowing passage to Arvandor.  As Lord of the Continuum, Labelas governs the orderly passage of time and guards against those who would alter the path of history.  Labelas confers wisdom and teachings on young and old alike, and although he is rarely invoked, the Lifegiver is often praised.  The Lifegiver knows the future and past of every elf, faerie, or sylvan creature.  Labelas is worshiped by sages, historians, philosophers, librarians, and all those who measure the changes wrought by the passing of years.\r\n\r\nWeight:  4 lb.",

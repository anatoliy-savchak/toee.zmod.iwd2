The first monk scooped the beautiful lady up in his arms and carried her across the stream, promptly setting her down and continuing on his way.  The second monk remained silent for several minutes as the woman disappeared from view.  Finally he spoke to his brother.\r\n\r\n'We shukenja are not supposed to have contact with women!  Why did you pick that woman up so casually and carry her across the stream?'\r\n\r\nThe first monk replied,\r\n\r\n'Brother, I set the woman down long ago.  Why is it that you have not?'\"\r\n\r\nWeight:  2 lb.",

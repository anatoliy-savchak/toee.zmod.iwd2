Many tragedies have occurred around these two items, and many are the deaths they caused although no arrow was ever shot from them. \r\n\r\nAt the height of the dwarven-elvish alliance in the North, a disagreement arose between the two races over the matter of trading enchanted weapons to the men of the south, who were beginning to establish a foothold in the North.  The dwarves were of the opinion that the many great works that had been built through the joint efforts of the dwarves and elves should be offered up to man and the profits used to fill the coffers of both races.  This suggestion was not well-received by the elves nor by their leader, the arch-mage Larrel, and the matter was quickly dropped. \r\n\r\nHowever, when the Arc of Gold, one of the items fashioned jointly by dwarven and elven weaponsmiths was found in the hands of an orcish war party not long after the debate in the alliance councils, the elves accused the dwarves of selling the weapons to the goblinoids out of greed.  The dwarves, insulted, broke the shafts of their hammers in the middle of the council and broke talks with the elves, returning to their halls in Dorn's Deep and never speaking to them again.  The two races, now divided, were soon swallowed by the Dark Horde that was devouring the North beneath its banner. \r\n\r\nAt the time of the fall of the Severed Hand, the Arc of Gold was mounted within the halls of Severed Hand as a reminder of the dwarven treachery and dwarven greed.  When the Severed Hand fell, the Arc of Gold silently watched as the goblinoids tore apart the elvish defenders and laid waste to tower after tower, until the elvish archmage Larrel, in a desperate measure, brought about the Mythal cataclysm that sealed the fate of the Severed Hand once and for all.  \r\n\r\nWhen the Mythal was cast, the Arc of Gold vanished from the halls of the Severed Hand and has not been seen since... until now.  \r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nDamage:  +6 (missile)\r\nAttack Bonus:  +6 \r\nWeight: 9 lb.\r\nFeat Requirement:  Martial Weapon, Bow\r\nType:  Two-handed",

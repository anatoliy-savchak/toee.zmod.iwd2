    "Text": "In the surviving teachings of the Kamjin-Doh of Kara-Tur, it is written that a true weapon master relies not on leather, chain, or plate, but on honing their skills so that they are never struck at all... and this means a weapon master must know their enemy's movements like the movements of their own hand.  But such mastery lies in staying focused upon your enemy even in the heat of battle... and these simple leather armbands are intended to do just that.  \r\n\r\nInitially used to help in the training of students at the Kamjin-Doh, these Bands of Focus radiate a soft moonlight glow when the light of dusk falls upon them.  While worn, they exert a slight calming influence on the mind of the sword saint that wields them, heightening the warrior's perceptions and senses, and allowing them to read the movements of their opponents easier.  On the rare occasion when an enemy strikes a sword saint, these bands allow the wielder to shrug off pain (which in the teachings of Kamjin-Doh are called, \"distractions\") and keep the pain where it belongs - on one's opponent. \r\n\r\nMany of these bands were scattered throughout Faerun in the wake of the destruction of the Kamjin-Doh at the hands of the Master of Razors.  It is rumored that the Master of Razors possessed a set of these bands as well, but their location remains a mystery. \r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nSpecial\r\n Damage reduction 5/+1\r\nWeight: 1 lb.\r\n",

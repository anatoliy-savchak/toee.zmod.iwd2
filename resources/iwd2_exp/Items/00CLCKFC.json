    "Text": "On the farms in the Dalelands west of the Moonsea, most of the men and women who work the fields lead simple, humble lives.  It is out of one such simple life that the legend of Behem Farmer of Mistledale emerged.  However, the circumstances surrounding his legend are far from typical.  While tending his farm near Sword Creek, bandit riders from the east rode forth and told him to surrender his land.  Behem was overcome with grief and could not answer them.  The leader of the bandits told Behem that he had until dawn of the next morning to vacate the land.  The bandits then rode towards other farms and told them the same thing.  At dusk, as the farmers cleared out their homes and prepared to fall back to defensible ground, some of the families saw the silhouette of Behem standing in his field, leaning upon his hoe, his head hung low.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, three farmers approached Behem's field and saw the farmer asleep in his field.  More shocking was the apparition of a woman, believed to be the spirit of Chauntea, wrapping Behem's loose cloak around him.  The farmers returned to their families and told everyone what they had witnessed.  Bolstered by the belief that Chauntea had blessed Behem for staying on his farm, the farmers gathered up their families and marched back to their farms.  Unfortunately, their bravery had returned a few moments too late.  Behem had just been killed by the bandits for refusing to leave.  Before the eyes of the farmers, thick vines erupted from the field the bandits stood upon.  The vegetation not only held the bandits firmly in place, but also thrashed and choked them into unconsciousness.  The farmers rushed forward and drove off the bandits who remained.  Though Behem's body disappeared with the vines, his bloodstained, tattered cloak remained behind.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nDeflection Bonus: +3 \r\nWeight: 3 lb.",

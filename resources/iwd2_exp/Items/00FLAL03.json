    "Text": "Skullflail, or \"The Flail of Teeth\" as it is more commonly known, was constructed in 1035 DR for the barbarian warlord Wychgar. During a battle in the northern wastes which became known as Hallowed Pass, Wychgar lost his three brothers to the orc army led by Kraag the Mighty. Wychgar was distraught and during the night he wandered the battlefield looking for their bodies to take away for proper burial. He stumbled across them and was visited by the brothers' spirits who were trapped between the land of the living and the land of the dead. Unable to help them leave he had their souls stored in the flail with the help of a shaman.\r\n\r\nThe three heads of the flail are his brother's skulls, which are attached to the shaft by silver chains. The three skull-heads grin maniacally at their new life. When the flail is used in combat the three heads bite the target, tearing and rendering flesh.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nDamage:  1d8 +4, and +1d4 piercing from the biting skulls\r\nAttack Bonus:  +4 \r\nEnchantment:  +4\r\nDamage Type:  Bludgeoning\r\nSpecial: 10% chance of an additional 1d6 piercing damage\r\nWeight:  4 lb.\r\nRequired Feat:  Martial Weapon, Flail\r\nType:  One-handed",

      "Text": "Skullflail, or \"The Flail of Teeth\" as it is more commonly known, was constructed in 1035 DR for the barbarian warlord Wychgar. During a battle in the northern wastes which became known as Hallowed Pass, Wychgar lost his three brothers to the orc army led by Kraag the Mighty. Wychgar was distraught and during the night he wandered the battlefield looking for their bodies to take away for proper burial. He stumbled across them and was visited by the brothers' spirits who were trapped between the land of the living and the land of the dead. Unable to help them leave he had their souls stored in the flail with the help of a shaman.\r\n\r\nThe three heads of the flail are his brother's skulls, which are attached to the shaft by silver chains. The three skull-heads grin maniacally at their new life. When the flail is used in combat the three heads bite the target, tearing and rendering flesh.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nDamage:  1d8 +4, and +1d4 piercing from the biting skulls\r\nAttack Bonus:  +4 \r\nEnchantment:  +4\r\nDamage Type:  Bludgeoning\r\nSpecial: 10% chance of an additional 1d6 piercing damage\r\nWeight:  4 lb.\r\nRequired Feat:  Martial Weapon, Flail\r\nType:  One-handed",

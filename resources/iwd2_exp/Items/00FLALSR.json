    "Text": "Lady Roa was a woman thrice betrayed.  First by her lord father, who married her to Duke Sorim for political gain despite knowing that he would relentlessly torment young Roa.  Second by her abusive husband the duke, who planted assassins amongst her handmaidens... when Roa visited her dearest brother Remin - a powerful baron - the assassins murdered him as he slept and so his lands passed to the duke.  The third and final betrayal was at the hands of her sister Rana, who longed to take the duke, his riches, and eventually the royal crown for her own.  Rana entwined herself in a plot with Duke Sorim to slay the king, discredit the true heir as his bastard child with Roa, and thereby steal the throne.\r\n\r\nRoa, still less than sixteen summers old, was bound with a ball and chain and cast into the duke's infamous dungeons to await the completion of her husband and sister's terrible scheme.  She sobbed and moaned day and night, her voice echoing through the keep's halls.   The duke soon grew incensed at her constant wailing and sent one of his Ducal Guard to beat little Roa into silence.  When the man arrived at the cell, he struck her across the face, shoved her to the ground and made to kick at her belly - but quick as that, Roa sprung up and strangled the man with her chains.\r\n\r\nMoments later the willowy young girl burst into the duke's court and attacked him savagely.  His guards pelted her with bolts from their crossbows, but onwards she charged.  When she reached the Ducal Throne she tossed Sorim's champion aside like a broken doll, swinging the iron ball of her shackles with such strength that it stove in the shocked duke's thrice-enchanted breastplate of meteoric iron, driving shards of shattered ribs into his lungs and heart and killing him instantly.\r\n\r\nNo one is clear as to how the tale ends - some say that Roa then expired on the spot, her chest and back bristling with bolts, while others describe how her sister Rana leapt up and killed her with a dagger... a few optimistic souls even claim that Roa lived and spent the rest of her days in peaceful bliss.  Whatever the case, her shackles remain as a testament to her story.\r\n\r\nThe chains of Roa's shackles have been looped and wound together in such a way that one can wield them as a flail.  Crudely etched into the soft iron of the ball are the words \"In Righteousness Lies My Strength.\"\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nDamage:  1d8  +1\r\nAttack Bonus:  +1 \r\nEnchantment:  +1\r\nDamage Type:  Bludgeoning\r\nSpecial:\r\n  33% chance of  +2 Strength on wielder when struck (melee only / non cumulative)\r\nWeight: 5 lb.\r\nRequired Feat:  Martial Weapon, Flail\r\nType:  One-handed",

      "Text": "Lady Roa was a woman thrice betrayed.  First by her lord father, who married her to Duke Sorim for political gain despite knowing that he would relentlessly torment young Roa.  Second by her abusive husband the duke, who planted assassins amongst her handmaidens... when Roa visited her dearest brother Remin - a powerful baron - the assassins murdered him as he slept and so his lands passed to the duke.  The third and final betrayal was at the hands of her sister Rana, who longed to take the duke, his riches, and eventually the royal crown for her own.  Rana entwined herself in a plot with Duke Sorim to slay the king, discredit the true heir as his bastard child with Roa, and thereby steal the throne.\r\n\r\nRoa, still less than sixteen summers old, was bound with a ball and chain and cast into the duke's infamous dungeons to await the completion of her husband and sister's terrible scheme.  She sobbed and moaned day and night, her voice echoing through the keep's halls.   The duke soon grew incensed at her constant wailing and sent one of his Ducal Guard to beat little Roa into silence.  When the man arrived at the cell, he struck her across the face, shoved her to the ground and made to kick at her belly - but quick as that, Roa sprung up and strangled the man with her chains.\r\n\r\nMoments later the willowy young girl burst into the duke's court and attacked him savagely.  His guards pelted her with bolts from their crossbows, but onwards she charged.  When she reached the Ducal Throne she tossed Sorim's champion aside like a broken doll, swinging the iron ball of her shackles with such strength that it stove in the shocked duke's thrice-enchanted breastplate of meteoric iron, driving shards of shattered ribs into his lungs and heart and killing him instantly.\r\n\r\nNo one is clear as to how the tale ends - some say that Roa then expired on the spot, her chest and back bristling with bolts, while others describe how her sister Rana leapt up and killed her with a dagger... a few optimistic souls even claim that Roa lived and spent the rest of her days in peaceful bliss.  Whatever the case, her shackles remain as a testament to her story.\r\n\r\nThe chains of Roa's shackles have been looped and wound together in such a way that one can wield them as a flail.  Crudely etched into the soft iron of the ball are the words \"In Righteousness Lies My Strength.\"\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nDamage:  1d8  +1\r\nAttack Bonus:  +1 \r\nEnchantment:  +1\r\nDamage Type:  Bludgeoning\r\nSpecial:\r\n  33% chance of  +2 Strength on wielder when struck (melee only / non cumulative)\r\nWeight: 5 lb.\r\nRequired Feat:  Martial Weapon, Flail\r\nType:  One-handed",

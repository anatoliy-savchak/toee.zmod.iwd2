    "Text": "Mounted knights cannot effectively use long pole weapons while on horseback, and as a result, many weapons have been fitted with shorter shafts so they may be wielded with just one hand.  Maces and flails are two previous examples of this - the warhammer is another.  The horseman's warhammer is the descendent of the Lucerne hammer.  It is made entirely of steel, with rondels protecting and strengthening the grip.  Rondels are small disks of metal, often shaped into decorative designs.  The shaft is about 18 inches long.",

    "Text": "This hammer was created by an ingenious gnomish inventor and wizard named Airon Broune. Actually no one really knows if Airon is a gnome or not because no one has actually seen him. Apparently overnight he had taken over an abandoned shop at the edge of small town. One day the shop was vacant and then the next it was boarded up tight with signs in every language telling passersby to go away. Infuriated, the previous owner demanded he leave, but quickly relinquished his claim to the shop when a large sack of gold appeared at his feet. The very next day, mysterious notes began to appear all over town. They all contained the same message and read as follows:\r\n\r\n**************************************\r\n\r\nBring potatoes. Will pay in gold.\r\n\r\n-Airon Broun\r\n\r\n**************************************\r\n\r\nIntrigued, a few townspeople decided to take him up on his offer and delivered sacks of potatoes to the shop. They would shove the potatoes into a delivery chute located in the back of the shop and then soon after a small sack of gold would appear, usually five times the going rate of the potatoes. The better the quality of the potatoes the more gold would appear. News soon spread of this wonderful offer and it was not long until every potato in town was sold to the curious gnome. No matter how many potatoes one delivered, there always appeared a sack of gold for payment. \r\n\r\nNeedless to say, every farm for miles around started growing potatoes. Each farmer would try to outdo the other by producing the biggest and tastiest potatoes. This continued on for years until finally, the quality of potatoes was so good that instead of gold appearing, magic items of all sorts would appear. Not realizing the magical nature of the items given, the farmers sold them to passing merchants in disgust and stopped farming potatoes altogether. This hammer is one such item. By inserting special enchanted plates into the head of the hammer, the user is able to modify the abilities of the hammer. This particular hammer comes with plates that will do extra acid, cold, or fire damage.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nDamage:  1d8 + 3\r\nAttack Bonus:  +3\r\nEnchantment:  +3\r\nDamage Type:  Bludgeoning\r\nSpecial 1:\r\n  Corrosive Burst: +1d6 acid damage and 10% chance of +1d10 extra acid damage\r\nSpecial 2:\r\n  Flaming Burst: +1d6 fire damage and 10% chance of +1d10 extra fire damage\r\nSpecial 3:\r\n  Frost Burst: +1d6 cold damage and 10% chance of +1d10 extra cold damage\r\nWeight: 7 lb.\r\nFeat Requirement:  Martial Weapon, Hammer\r\nType:  One-handed",

Maces and flails are two previous examples of this - the warhammer is another.  The horseman's warhammer is the descendent of the Lucerne hammer.  It is made entirely of steel, with rondels protecting and strengthening the grip.  Rondels are small disks of metal, often shaped into decorative designs.  The shaft is about 18 inches long.",

      "Text": "This hammer was created by an ingenious gnomish inventor and wizard named Airon Broune. Actually no one really knows if Airon is a gnome or not because no one has actually seen him. Apparently overnight he had taken over an abandoned shop at the edge of small town. One day the shop was vacant and then the next it was boarded up tight with signs in every language telling passersby to go away. Infuriated, the previous owner demanded he leave, but quickly relinquished his claim to the shop when a large sack of gold appeared at his feet. The very next day, mysterious notes began to appear all over town. They all contained the same message and read as follows:\r\n\r\n**************************************\r\n\r\nBring potatoes. Will pay in gold.\r\n\r\n-Airon Broun\r\n\r\n**************************************\r\n\r\nIntrigued, a few townspeople decided to take him up on his offer and delivered sacks of potatoes to the shop. They would shove the potatoes into a delivery chute located in the back of the shop and then soon after a small sack of gold would appear, usually five times the going rate of the potatoes. The better the quality of the potatoes the more gold would appear. News soon spread of this wonderful offer and it was not long until every potato in town was sold to the curious gnome. No matter how many potatoes one delivered, there always appeared a sack of gold for payment. \r\n\r\nNeedless to say, every farm for miles around started growing potatoes. Each farmer would try to outdo the other by producing the biggest and tastiest potatoes. This continued on for years until finally, the quality of potatoes was so good that instead of gold appearing, magic items of all sorts would appear. Not realizing the magical nature of the items given, the farmers sold them to passing merchants in disgust and stopped farming potatoes altogether. This hammer is one such item. By inserting special enchanted plates into the head of the hammer, the user is able to modify the abilities of the hammer. This particular hammer comes with plates that will do extra acid, cold, or fire damage.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nDamage:  1d8 + 3\r\nAttack Bonus:  +3\r\nEnchantment:  +3\r\nDamage Type:  Bludgeoning\r\nSpecial 1:\r\n  Corrosive Burst: +1d6 acid damage and 10% chance of +1d10 extra acid damage\r\nSpecial 2:\r\n  Flaming Burst: +1d6 fire damage and 10% chance of +1d10 extra fire damage\r\nSpecial 3:\r\n  Frost Burst: +1d6 cold damage and 10% chance of +1d10 extra cold damage\r\nWeight: 7 lb.\r\nFeat Requirement:  Martial Weapon, Hammer\r\nType:  One-handed",

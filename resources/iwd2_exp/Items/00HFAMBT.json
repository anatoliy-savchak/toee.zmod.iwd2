    "Text": " Belib the Wary was a very bright gnome, and self-proclaimed adventurer, who believed in covering every angle of his tiny arse before leaving on grand quests.  He created magical items that literally saturated the gamut of possible situations that could arise from his high adventures.  These magical items would have been the envy of all adventurers, had Belib been successful in leaving his domicile with his equipment.\r\n\r\nAfter many years of creating his incredible inventory of enchanted do-dads, Belib finally gathered his wares into an immense backpack (naturally, it was enchanted to carry far more than what would normally fit into a gnome's pack) and set out to quest for the grandest quests.  Unfortunately for Belib, one of his tiny feet tripped over his home's threshold and he was summarily crushed under the enormous weight of his pack.  The backpack burst open and scattered his enchanted wares all across his front yard.  One would like to think that passing sentient beings would stop and help the crushed gnome, but the most that passersby did was loot Belib's goods.\r\n\r\nOne of Belib's more popular goodies, especially with the vermin that make stealing and looting a career, was Belib's Multiple Tool of Fortune.  Disguised as an ornate amulet, this tool would help make even the most inept rogue a master of lock picking and trap disarming.  As is usually the case with items that aid in the thieving arts, Belib's Multiple Tool has found its way into many greased palms over the years.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nSpecial:\r\n Open Lock skill: +2\r\n Search skill: +2 \r\n Saving Throw Bonus: +1 to all\r\nWeight: 1 lb.\r\n",

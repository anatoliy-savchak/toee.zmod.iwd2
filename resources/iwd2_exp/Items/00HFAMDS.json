    "Text": "Versions of these sand-colored stones were fashioned by druids watching the borders of the Anauroch Desert, but this particular stone was worn by Theon, who was believed to have organized the Anauroch vigil based on portents he had received upon the winter winds.  When Atalacyls the Lost eventually crossed the boundaries of the Anauroch desert, Theon gathered the druids to him and engaged him in battle on the sands.  Despite the powers of their stones, Atalacyls defeated them to a man and turned their bodies to sand, then made a small pile of their druid stones as a warning to others not to follow him on his path.  He continued his journey westwards until he was found by Old Duke Kholsa Ehld, and the two of them met in battle over Atalacyls' crimes against the Weeping Queen.\r\n\r\nWhile worn, this stone allows the druid to ask favors of the earth and stones beneath their feet.  In times of danger, the stone can summon the strength of the earth to their aid, causing rocky stalactites to erupt from the earth, the area to blossom with spikes, or the wearer's skin to become as hard as stone and giving them some protection against attacks. \r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nSpecial:\r\n Spell Power:  Can cast spell Spike Growth once per day\r\n Spell Power:  Can cast the spell Stoneskin once per day\r\n Spell Power:  Can cast the spell Spike Stones once per day\r\nWeight: 1 lb.",

      "Text": "Versions of these sand-colored stones were fashioned by druids watching the borders of the Anauroch Desert, but this particular stone was worn by Theon, who was believed to have organized the Anauroch vigil based on portents he had received upon the winter winds.  When Atalacyls the Lost eventually crossed the boundaries of the Anauroch desert, Theon gathered the druids to him and engaged him in battle on the sands.  Despite the powers of their stones, Atalacyls defeated them to a man and turned their bodies to sand, then made a small pile of their druid stones as a warning to others not to follow him on his path.  He continued his journey westwards until he was found by Old Duke Kholsa Ehld, and the two of them met in battle over Atalacyls' crimes against the Weeping Queen.\r\n\r\nWhile worn, this stone allows the druid to ask favors of the earth and stones beneath their feet.  In times of danger, the stone can summon the strength of the earth to their aid, causing rocky stalactites to erupt from the earth, the area to blossom with spikes, or the wearer's skin to become as hard as stone and giving them some protection against attacks. \r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nSpecial:\r\n Spell Power:  Can cast spell Spike Growth once per day\r\n Spell Power:  Can cast the spell Stoneskin once per day\r\n Spell Power:  Can cast the spell Spike Stones once per day\r\nWeight: 1 lb.",

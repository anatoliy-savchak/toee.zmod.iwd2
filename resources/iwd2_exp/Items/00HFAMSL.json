    "Text": "Shamans of many barbarian clans have long looked upon the snow leopard as one of the most graceful and swift hunters of the frozen lands.  Many times the warriors of these clans mimic the movements of the large, white cats during fierce combat.  In addition, the barbarian shamans would sometimes create spells that would temporarily imbue the warriors with the dexterity of the snow leopards.  However, since these spells were temporary, often times the spell would wear off at inopportune times.\r\n\r\nIt is said, however, that a group of barbarian shamans once congregated deep within the Dales to find a way to better harness the swift agility of the snow leopard.  For nearly a year the shamans remained out of sight from their home clans, busily focusing their attentions towards the magic of the snow leopard.  Then one day, the shamans returned to their respective clans, each holding a small necklace made of silver, with a pendant that resembled a snow leopard's paw.  The shamans gave this pendant to their strongest warriors of each clan.  Once placed around the neck of the warrior, the dexterity of the snow leopard filled their powerful bodies, as well as immunity to the cold that surrounded the Dales.  From then on, the Heart of the Snow Leopard Charm, as it became known, would become one of the most prized artifacts within barbarian clans.  Only the mightiest warriors wore the amulet, and it became the goal of all young warriors to one day be adorned with the Heart of the Snow Leopard Charm.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nSpecial:\r\n Dexterity: +4 bonus\r\n Resistance: 4/- Cold Resistance\r\nWeight: 1 lb.\r\n",

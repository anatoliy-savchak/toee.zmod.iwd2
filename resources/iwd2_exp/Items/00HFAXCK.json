    "Text": "The Dwarven master smith, Magmar Ironsmelt, created this axe. It is said that he spent his entire life studying various blacksmithing techniques in preparation for creating this axe. Thirty days and thirty nights, Magmar secluded himself in his shop with only the steady ringing of his hammer and the deafening roar of the furnace as company. On the thirtieth night Magmar completed Stormshifter whereupon he promptly fell over dead. Now it is rumored that although the utmost respect was offered by his fellow smiths during his funeral, titters of laughter could be heard behind muffled, closely held conversations. It seems that Magmar's final work was not the great work everyone was expecting, in fact it was rather plain and hardly worthy of a Dwarven forged weapon let alone one forged by a master smith. \r\n\r\nFor many years this long forgotten weapon hung upon the walls of Clan Ironsmelt, until one fateful day a horde of goblins invaded. In the final moments of the battle, a lone injured dwarf grabbed Stormshifter in desperation from its purchase and flung it at the approaching horde. To his surprise, Stormshifter transformed into a ball of pure energy and surged thru the throngs of goblins with deadly accuracy. As fast as he could throw the axe it would return, leaving smoldering corpses wherever it traveled. By any rights this should have been a tale of legend, but with any legend there has to be survivors to tell the tale. Unfortunately, Clan Ironsmelt died that day along with that unnamed dwarf.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nThrown:\r\n\r\nDamage:  2d6\r\nDamage Type:  Electrical\r\nEnchantment:  +5\r\nSpecial:\r\n  Returning: Returns to user\r\n  Ball Lightning: Inflicts electrical damage to all objects within a 5' radius\r\n\r\nMelee:\r\n\r\nDamage:  1d6 +5\r\nAttack Bonus: +5\r\nDamage Type: Slashing\r\nWeight: 4 lb.\r\nRequired Feat:  Martial Weapon, Axe\r\nType:  One-handed",

      "Text": "The Dwarven master smith, Magmar Ironsmelt, created this axe. It is said that he spent his entire life studying various blacksmithing techniques in preparation for creating this axe. Thirty days and thirty nights, Magmar secluded himself in his shop with only the steady ringing of his hammer and the deafening roar of the furnace as company. On the thirtieth night Magmar completed Stormshifter whereupon he promptly fell over dead. Now it is rumored that although the utmost respect was offered by his fellow smiths during his funeral, titters of laughter could be heard behind muffled, closely held conversations. It seems that Magmar's final work was not the great work everyone was expecting, in fact it was rather plain and hardly worthy of a Dwarven forged weapon let alone one forged by a master smith. \r\n\r\nFor many years this long forgotten weapon hung upon the walls of Clan Ironsmelt, until one fateful day a horde of goblins invaded. In the final moments of the battle, a lone injured dwarf grabbed Stormshifter in desperation from its purchase and flung it at the approaching horde. To his surprise, Stormshifter transformed into a ball of pure energy and surged thru the throngs of goblins with deadly accuracy. As fast as he could throw the axe it would return, leaving smoldering corpses wherever it traveled. By any rights this should have been a tale of legend, but with any legend there has to be survivors to tell the tale. Unfortunately, Clan Ironsmelt died that day along with that unnamed dwarf.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nThrown:\r\n\r\nDamage:  2d6\r\nDamage Type:  Electrical\r\nEnchantment:  +5\r\nSpecial:\r\n  Returning: Returns to user\r\n  Ball Lightning: Inflicts electrical damage to all objects within a 5' radius\r\n\r\nMelee:\r\n\r\nDamage:  1d6 +5\r\nAttack Bonus: +5\r\nDamage Type: Slashing\r\nWeight: 4 lb.\r\nRequired Feat:  Martial Weapon, Axe\r\nType:  One-handed",

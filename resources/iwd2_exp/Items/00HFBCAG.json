Many tragedies have occurred around these two items, and many are the deaths they caused although no arrow was ever shot from them. \r\n\r\nThe Mithral Arc was developed at the height of the dwarven-elvish alliance, and it was one of the many joint items developed by the dwarves and elves of the Severed Hand before the destruction of the Severed Hand and the Fall of Dorn's Deep.  Its accuracy was unparalleled, and the dwarves presented it to the elves as a token of goodwill between the races. The string of the bow was said to have been blessed by the elvish archmage Larrel himself, with a range that seemed to rival the horizon.  It was mounted in the halls of Severed Hand so that all visitors could see it, and see the achievements the dwarves and elves united could bring about.\r\n\r\nWhen its brother, the Arc of Gold, was discovered in the hands of a band of orcs raiding in the forests north of Severed Hand, the elves became furious and accused the dwarves of selling the relics the two races had jointly crafted to their enemies.  The dwarves, enraged by the insult, seized the Mithral Arc and returned to Dorn's Deep, cutting off all contact with the elves. \r\n\r\nIt is said that at the moment the alliance disbanded, the string of the Mithral Arc broke with a final twang, and the bow, useless, remained deep within Lower Dorn's Deep, silently watching as the dwarves were slowly driven deeper and deeper into the Deep by the encroaching goblinoid hordes that had begun to swarm down from the North.  It was never seen and never taken by the Dark Horde that marched through Dorn's Deep, and the Mithral Arc remained there for countless years in the darkness with the dwarven dead piled around it, still clutching their weapons.  \r\n\r\nHow it came to be here is unknown, but the string of the Mithral Arc is restored and the bow is eager to be used.  Perhaps there is hope for the fallen elves and dwarves still... or at least the opportunity to reclaim their once-proud homeland from the goblin hordes that threaten it. \r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nDamage:  +7 (missile)\r\nAttack Bonus:  +7\r\nWeight: 9 lb.\r\nFeat Requirement:  Martial Weapon, Bow\r\nType:  Two-handed\r\n",

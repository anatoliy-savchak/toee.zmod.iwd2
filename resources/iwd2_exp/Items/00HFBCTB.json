Unfortunately, Tamjan was called upon repeatedly to assist his father in the expansion of their family bakery.  To establish a reputation among the cities of the north, Tamjan would magically preserve the freshness of his father's baked goods as he whisked them away to important events from Luskan to Silverymoon.  Tamjan hated assisting his father.  It made him the butt of jokes in wizardly circles across the north.  Tamjan eventually decided to hire a group of bandits to attack him and his father as they traveled to Luskan.  The young mage believed that the attack would scare his father into giving up his outlandish plan to establish bakeries across the north.  The bandits became overzealous in the execution of their role.  Weeks later, all the Neverwinter scouts found were Tamjan's magical bracers lying in a puddle of slush.\r\n\r\nThe bracers are made of fine pinewood and leather with steel reinforcements.

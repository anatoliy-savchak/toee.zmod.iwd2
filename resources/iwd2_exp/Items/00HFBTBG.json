Legends say that the Blessed Black Goat appeared to a nameless halfling village that had been sacked by goblins during a terrible winter.  The tribe of warriors slew most of the halfling men, burned the fields, and took all of the town's livestock.  Broken but not hopeless, the villagers congregated for prayer in the burned chapel at the center of town.  Out of the smoke drifting over the edge of town, a black goat appeared with six kids, five black, one white.  Over the course of six weeks, the kids miraculously grew, gave birth to six more kids, and then died in the night.  The milk, meat, and hide provided by the goats helped the halflings survive through their harsh winter.  After the six weeks of miracles had passed, the town tanner made a belt from the hide of the mother goat that had appeared out of the smoke.  Halfling tales often contain stories of halfling heroes wearing the Blessed Black Goat Girdle on their adventures, though no one has yet determined exactly where the legend truly originated.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nRegeneration: Wearer heals 1 hit point every 3 rounds\r\nSaving Throw: +2 bonus\r\nWeight: 3 lb.",

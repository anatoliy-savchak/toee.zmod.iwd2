Fashioned by the dwarven giant slayer, the Little Giant Hohn Burninghair, the buckle of this belt is actually the petrified eye of a firbolg shaman that Hohn fought during his travels.  In incorporating the eye into the belt, however, some of the essence of the shaman was transferred along with it, including the northern flu it had when Burninghair laid it low.  As a result, any creatures attempting to focus on the wearer will find tears springing to their eyes, clouding their vision, and find their heads begin to become stuffy and cold.  For some reason, this enchantment seems to interfere with the perceptions of dead creatures and constructs as well, but the reason for this is unknown.\r\n\r\nHohn lost this belt when he was attempting to wade across a stream in pursuit of a fleeing verbeeg giant who had made off with one of his ponies.  The belt was washed downstream and eventually ended up in the hands of a simple trapper, who traded the ugly thing to a wandering tinker. \r\n\r\nThis belt grants the wearer tremendous strength and also blurs the vision of anyone looking at the wearer.  Due to the tears it causes in the eyes of anyone looking at it, any warrior wearing one of these items is often told to take it off by their companions.  When the belt wearer threatens to rip a tree out of the ground and club the requester for asking, however, the matter is usually dropped.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nSpecial:\r\n Strength: +6 bonus\r\n Constant Effect:  Under the effects of the spell Blur while equipped.\r\nWeight: 2 lb.\r\n",

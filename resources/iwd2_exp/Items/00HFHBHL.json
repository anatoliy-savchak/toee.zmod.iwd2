    "Text": "This odd pole-arm appears to be a cross between a halberd and a warhammer, fitted with a four-pronged hammerhead and a long thrusting spike.\r\n\r\nIts creation was the result of a blunder made during the commission of an enchanted item for Lodur the Brave (alternately known as Lodur Iron-Bollocks, Lodur the Foolhardy, and Lodur the Dullard), a powerful but none-to-bright cleric.  Lodur had of heard rumors of a mighty long-hafted hammer, possibly wielded by a hero known as Lucerne, or perhaps that's where it was made, which may or may not have had to do with a land or king or deity called Swizaria, or Switzlund, or \"something of that nature, I am most certain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" he had then added, \"and pray thee bless it as well... thou dost know, that one where it explodes undead most explosively and what-not, so that I might get my most righteous smite on.\"\r\n\r\nLodur's fierce demeanor, violent reputation, and sacks of gold begged quiet compliance, and so the dwarven arms-master simply nodded and sent the cleric on his way, promising the weapon in two months' time.  The arm-master consulted with his clan's lore-master and sure enough, there *was* word of such a weapon: it came from a trader in Sigil by way of an exceptionally well-traveled plane-walker.  The arms-master dutifully copied the weapon's function and form, working runes of power into its haft and head just as Lodur had asked for.\r\n\r\nWhen Lodur the Brave returned to the dwarven stronghold to pick up his new hammer, he found instead a spiked pole-arm whose use was forbidden by his religion.  The cleric ranted and gnashed his teeth and swore up and down the halls of the clan before stomping off in disgust, leaving his payment and the somewhat inappropriately named \"Holy Swizarnian Hammer of Lucerne\" behind.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nDamage:  1d10 + 3\r\nAttack Bonus:  +3 \r\nEnchantment:  +3\r\nDamage Type:  Piercing\r\nSpecial:\r\n  Disruption: all undead and outsiders struck must make a Fortitude save or be destroyed\r\n  Spell Process: 25% chance of casting a variant Holy Smite on target with each successful hit\r\nWeight: 15 lb.\r\nFeat Requirement:  Martial Weapon, Polearm\r\nType:  Two-handed",

The axe blade is balanced at the rear with a fluke, and surmounted by a sharp spike, usually of quadrangular design.  The fluke is sometimes replaced by a hook used to dismount cavalry.  A halberd can be best described as a cross between a spear and an axe.  ",

      "Text": "This odd pole-arm appears to be a cross between a halberd and a warhammer, fitted with a four-pronged hammerhead and a long thrusting spike.\r\n\r\nIts creation was the result of a blunder made during the commission of an enchanted item for Lodur the Brave (alternately known as Lodur Iron-Bollocks, Lodur the Foolhardy, and Lodur the Dullard), a powerful but none-to-bright cleric.  Lodur had of heard rumors of a mighty long-hafted hammer, possibly wielded by a hero known as Lucerne, or perhaps that's where it was made, which may or may not have had to do with a land or king or deity called Swizaria, or Switzlund, or \"something of that nature, I am most certain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" he had then added, \"and pray thee bless it as well... thou dost know, that one where it explodes undead most explosively and what-not, so that I might get my most righteous smite on.\"\r\n\r\nLodur's fierce demeanor, violent reputation, and sacks of gold begged quiet compliance, and so the dwarven arms-master simply nodded and sent the cleric on his way, promising the weapon in two months' time.  The arm-master consulted with his clan's lore-master and sure enough, there *was* word of such a weapon: it came from a trader in Sigil by way of an exceptionally well-traveled plane-walker.  The arms-master dutifully copied the weapon's function and form, working runes of power into its haft and head just as Lodur had asked for.\r\n\r\nWhen Lodur the Brave returned to the dwarven stronghold to pick up his new hammer, he found instead a spiked pole-arm whose use was forbidden by his religion.  The cleric ranted and gnashed his teeth and swore up and down the halls of the clan before stomping off in disgust, leaving his payment and the somewhat inappropriately named \"Holy Swizarnian Hammer of Lucerne\" behind.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nDamage:  1d10 + 3\r\nAttack Bonus:  +3 \r\nEnchantment:  +3\r\nDamage Type:  Piercing\r\nSpecial:\r\n  Disruption: all undead and outsiders struck must make a Fortitude save or be destroyed\r\n  Spell Process: 25% chance of casting a variant Holy Smite on target with each successful hit\r\nWeight: 15 lb.\r\nFeat Requirement:  Martial Weapon, Polearm\r\nType:  Two-handed",

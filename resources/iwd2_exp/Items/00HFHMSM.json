    "Text": "Aeryl Goldenbeard was a particularly flamboyant pirate that sailed the seas off the coast of Amn.  He was the captain of the pirate warship, The Bouncing Rhonda; a twenty gun cutter that was considered one of the fastest vessels on the high seas.  Those unfortunate merchant ships that crossed paths with The Bouncing Rhonda were never able to outrun the cutter, were summarily boarded and their merchandise stolen.  \r\n\r\nNow, the fact that Captain Aeryl Goldenbeard and his hearty men of The Bouncing Rhonda successfully pirated ships was not so unusual.  No, the unusual part was that after the men of The Bouncing Rhonda successfully seized a merchant vessel, Captain Aeryl Goldenbeard would jump from the crow's nest, grab a rope in mid flight that was tied to the mast, gallantly swing down and land elegantly upon the deck of the merchant ship.  At almost the same time Captain Aeryl Goldenbeard's feet touched the merchant ship's deck, the captured crew took an instant liking to the pirate captain.  In fact, it was not uncommon for a majority of the captured crews to beg for a commission on The Bouncing Rhonda.  However, the instant the pirate captain and his crew left the merchant ship (along with its cargo), the remaining merchant ship's crew immediately resumed their hatred for the pirate captain.\r\n\r\nNo one knew why or how Captain Aeryl Goldenbeard managed to charm his victims so well.  That is, not until one day, while the good pirate captain was making one of his famous entrances via rope and mast, his colorful bandana flew off his near balding head.  The second his foot touched the deck, all the former merchant crews that went along with the pirate ship instantly came to their senses and summarily beat the pirate captain to death.  It did not take long for those around to realize that the pirate captain's bandana held magical properties that made him seem more charming.  \r\n\r\nUnfortunately for the remaining pirate and merchant crew, the bandana flew into the sea.  However, rumors would pop up from time to time that a particularly dashing swashbuckler had the uncanny ability to charm his way out of trouble and liked to swing from mast ropes - and that he wore a very colorful bandana.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nArmor Bonus: +3 (generic)\r\nSpecial:\r\n Charisma: +3 bonus\r\n Spell Power: Can cast the spell Charm Person twice per day\r\nWeight: 1 lb.\r\n",

    "Text": "\"It was during Borab the Reaver's sacking of the Blue Citadel that Alemis Peacemaker - youngest son of Earl Marimor Peacemaker, lord of the Blue Citadel - stole into the locked vault his father had thought so well-hidden.  There, alone in the cavernous chamber, were Bloody Wroth, Hateful, and Furious - the dread sword, axe, and armor of Hurom, ancient ancestor of Alemis, once known as the Bloody Juggernaut before he broke his cursed iron's spell and took the Peacemaker name.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alemis, a mere boy, donned the fell armor and took Bloody Wroth and Hateful in hand.  Alone he cut his way through Borab's motley horde of humanoid raiders until he faced the towering half-giant himself, hacking him down and scattering his army to the wind.  His family - father, mother, brothers and sisters alike - had all died by then, but Alemis no longer cared.  He stalked the realms, eyes ablaze with madness, slaying monsters and brigands wherever he found them.  But as the years passed and Alemis found no more of such wheat to thresh, he took to turning his thirsting blades on all who crossed his path... and so, once more, the Bloody Juggernaut had returned.\"\r\n\r\n  -- from \"Master Pelib's Bedtime Tales\"\r\n\r\nThis heavy, unadorned bastard sword of dull gray steel is a cursed thing, only showing its true form when the wielder is wounded in battle.  It is then that the hilt sprouts crimson tendrils that bury themselves in the wielder's forearm; drinking his or her blood, the demon-sword opens the three glaring eyes along its twisting, dripping blade and drives the wielder mad with lust for bloodshed.\r\n\r\nShould a warrior carry Bloody Wroth along with its brothers Hateful and Furious, his or her soul would be lost to the hell-forged arms and armor.  To wield even Bloody Wroth alone might be construed as insanity... but there will always be those for whom it may be just the weapon they're looking for.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nDamage:  1d10 + 3\r\nAttack Bonus: +3 bonus\r\nEnchantment:  +3\r\nDamage Type:  Slashing\r\nSpecial:\r\n  Cursed: Can only be unequipped with a Remove Curse spell\r\n  Wrathful Blood: 66% of casting Blood Rage on the wielder each time he or she is wounded\r\nWeight: 10 lb.\r\nFeat Requirement:  Exotic Weapon, Bastard Sword\r\nType:  One-handed",

      "Text": "\"It was during Borab the Reaver's sacking of the Blue Citadel that Alemis Peacemaker - youngest son of Earl Marimor Peacemaker, lord of the Blue Citadel - stole into the locked vault his father had thought so well-hidden.  There, alone in the cavernous chamber, were Bloody Wroth, Hateful, and Furious - the dread sword, axe, and armor of Hurom, ancient ancestor of Alemis, once known as the Bloody Juggernaut before he broke his cursed iron's spell and took the Peacemaker name.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alemis, a mere boy, donned the fell armor and took Bloody Wroth and Hateful in hand.  Alone he cut his way through Borab's motley horde of humanoid raiders until he faced the towering half-giant himself, hacking him down and scattering his army to the wind.  His family - father, mother, brothers and sisters alike - had all died by then, but Alemis no longer cared.  He stalked the realms, eyes ablaze with madness, slaying monsters and brigands wherever he found them.  But as the years passed and Alemis found no more of such wheat to thresh, he took to turning his thirsting blades on all who crossed his path... and so, once more, the Bloody Juggernaut had returned.\"\r\n\r\n  -- from \"Master Pelib's Bedtime Tales\"\r\n\r\nThis heavy, unadorned bastard sword of dull gray steel is a cursed thing, only showing its true form when the wielder is wounded in battle.  It is then that the hilt sprouts crimson tendrils that bury themselves in the wielder's forearm; drinking his or her blood, the demon-sword opens the three glaring eyes along its twisting, dripping blade and drives the wielder mad with lust for bloodshed.\r\n\r\nShould a warrior carry Bloody Wroth along with its brothers Hateful and Furious, his or her soul would be lost to the hell-forged arms and armor.  To wield even Bloody Wroth alone might be construed as insanity... but there will always be those for whom it may be just the weapon they're looking for.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nDamage:  1d10 + 3\r\nAttack Bonus: +3 bonus\r\nEnchantment:  +3\r\nDamage Type:  Slashing\r\nSpecial:\r\n  Cursed: Can only be unequipped with a Remove Curse spell\r\n  Wrathful Blood: 66% of casting Blood Rage on the wielder each time he or she is wounded\r\nWeight: 10 lb.\r\nFeat Requirement:  Exotic Weapon, Bastard Sword\r\nType:  One-handed",

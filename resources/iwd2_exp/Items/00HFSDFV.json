    "Text": "It is rare that the residents of the Ten-Towns willingly interfere in the affairs of the native barbarians.  Occasionally, the townsmen cannot help but come across a landmark or religious site that the barbarians erected.  Twenty years ago, Sammel Colger of Bremen was fishing near the Sea of Moving Ice when he discovered the remnants of a small barbarian ship.  He was drawn to a particular piece of the hull that had a colorful painting on the side.  As he pulled the wood from the water, a polar bear leapt up from the depths and struck at the young man's head.  Instinctively, he pulled the wood towards his face.  The bear's huge talons were deflected.  Amazingly, the creature slipped and fell back into the cold water.  Not hesitating to see what the bear would do, Sammel rushed back to his small ship and returned to Bremen.  A priest of Tempus later told the young man that the painting was of a sacrificial virgin.  He believed that the small boat must have drifted all the way from Maer Dualdon to the Sea of Moving Ice, where it was smashed to pieces.  Sammel had the wood fashioned into a shield, which he took with him on his far-reaching fishing trips until the end of his days.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nShield Bonus: +4\r\nDexterity: +3 bonus\r\nArmor Check Penalty:  -1\r\nArcane Spell Failure:  15%\r\nWeight: 15 lb.",

      "Text": "It is rare that the residents of the Ten-Towns willingly interfere in the affairs of the native barbarians.  Occasionally, the townsmen cannot help but come across a landmark or religious site that the barbarians erected.  Twenty years ago, Sammel Colger of Bremen was fishing near the Sea of Moving Ice when he discovered the remnants of a small barbarian ship.  He was drawn to a particular piece of the hull that had a colorful painting on the side.  As he pulled the wood from the water, a polar bear leapt up from the depths and struck at the young man's head.  Instinctively, he pulled the wood towards his face.  The bear's huge talons were deflected.  Amazingly, the creature slipped and fell back into the cold water.  Not hesitating to see what the bear would do, Sammel rushed back to his small ship and returned to Bremen.  A priest of Tempus later told the young man that the painting was of a sacrificial virgin.  He believed that the small boat must have drifted all the way from Maer Dualdon to the Sea of Moving Ice, where it was smashed to pieces.  Sammel had the wood fashioned into a shield, which he took with him on his far-reaching fishing trips until the end of his days.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nShield Bonus: +4\r\nDexterity: +3 bonus\r\nArmor Check Penalty:  -1\r\nArcane Spell Failure:  15%\r\nWeight: 15 lb.",

Apparently, after being forced to debase himself before the Hosttower during a trading agreement in Luskan (and being forced to surrender much of his cargo), the merchant became obsessed with wiping the Hosttower from the face of Faerun.  Commissioning wizards in Waterdeep to fashion a score of rings for him, he set about using the last of his remaining wealth to hire a band of wizard slayers to bring about the downfall of the Hosttower.  These twenty wizard slayers made arrangements to travel north on their own and rendezvous with the merchant in Luskan. \r\n\r\nIronically enough, the merchant never wore one of these rings, which was key in exposing and defeating the movement.  As soon as he returned to Luskan, his mind picked apart by telepaths and his movements scried, and each wizard slayer and accomplice were noted, identified, and ultimately led into deathtraps where their rings proved no match against the summoned monsters and arrows of slaying wielded by the ambush parties.  It is rumored that only one wizard slayer, Martek, escaped the Hosttower, and to this day, he has never been found, which has been a constant source of irritation to the mages. \r\n\r\nIn any event, the Circle of Ice died a quick, silent death in Luskan, but the merchant lived on as a toy of the Hosttower, serving them until death, at which point, his corpse was stored in their laboratories.  It is most likely his preserved body will end up as the left arm of a flesh golem named Bok many years from now. \r\n\r\nThese small bands of Cold Reflection appear to be made of crystallized ice, very cold to the touch, and they cannot be seen by a wizard unless the wizard knows they are there. \r\n\r\nIf your band contains one that fancies him or herself a wizard slayer, perhaps these rings may be used for the purpose they were intended... but without the shortsightedness of foolish merchants handicapping your efforts. \r\n \r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nSpecial:\r\n Resistance: 4/- Magic Resistance\r\nWeight: 0 lb.",

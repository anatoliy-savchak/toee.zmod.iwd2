It is heavy even for a shield of its size, much of the weight coming from a large sculpted dragon's head set into its face - the head, wrought in the same red metal as the rest of the shield, protrudes almost like a gargoyle from a castle wall.\r\n\r\nThe head is the likeness of Red Fang, one-time mount of a tyrannical warrior-king from a land long ago forgotten.  When Red Fang was slain in battle, the warrior-king had the beast's soul bound to this shield so that the faithful dragon could still accompany him into battle.  Once per day Red Fang's iron head can breathe a gout of searing flame at the shield-bearer's command.\r\n\r\nThe warrior-king was eventually slain himself by a trio of brave heroes.  Though his shield has been sighted numerous times throughout the realms, his great horned helm and mighty golden axe have yet to be rediscovered.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nShield Bonus: +3\r\nArmor Bonus:  +1 vs. missile weapons\r\nSpecial:\r\n  Spell Power: Can cast the spell  Agannazar's Scorcher 1/day\r\nArmor Check Penalty:  -9\r\nArcane Spell Failure:  50%\r\nWeight: 30 lb.",

It is heavy even for a shield of its size, much of the weight coming from a large sculpted dragon's head set into its face - the head, wrought in the same red metal as the rest of the shield, protrudes almost like a gargoyle from a castle wall.\r\n\r\nThe head is the likeness of Red Fang, one-time mount of a tyrannical warrior-king from a land long ago forgotten.  When Red Fang was slain in battle, the warrior-king had the beast's soul bound to this shield so that the faithful dragon could still accompany him into battle.  Once per day Red Fang's iron head can breathe a gout of searing flame at the shield-bearer's command.\r\n\r\nThe warrior-king was eventually slain himself by a trio of brave heroes.  Though his shield has been sighted numerous times throughout the realms, his great horned helm and mighty golden axe have yet to be rediscovered.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nShield Bonus: +3\r\nArmor Bonus:  +1 vs. missile weapons\r\nSpecial:\r\n  Spell Power: Can cast the spell  Agannazar's Scorcher 1/day\r\nArmor Check Penalty:  -9\r\nArcane Spell Failure:  50%\r\nWeight: 30 lb.",

Dullcobble, realizing he had to back his proud words, agreed heartily... but inside, he was struck with fear that he would fail the test.\r\n\r\nDullcobble made several attempts to fashion a chopping axe, most of them ending up as cordwood next to his fireplace.  In the day before his challenge was to be called due, his only surviving weapon was a lop-sided axe whose haft was widely overbalanced. Realizing that displaying such a weapon would make him the laughing stock of the community, Dullcobble hired a wild mage to take his misshapen axe and turn it into a serviceable weapon.  The mage shrugged, took his payment, and promised the axe to Dullcobble on the dawn of the next day.  When Dullcobble woke up in the morning, the misshapen axe lay on his doorstep, unchanged, and he had no choice but to take the axe to his challengers... and take his chances. \r\n\r\nWhen Dullcobble brought it into the town's meeting hall, the axe's appearance was greeted with derision and laughter.  Dullcobble, his face burning, became so angry he threw it at his tormenters - and watched as the haft traveled over the blade's head to smash into a pillar and shatter it, causing the roof to collapse.  Dullcobble, slack-jawed with surprise, was knocked unconscious by a falling timber, but the other challengers made it outside without injury.  \r\n\r\nDullcobble's blow to the head was a serious one, and it turned him into the village idiot - not much of a change from his previous lifestyle.  The axe itself was tossed upon a merchant cart headed north, and it was never seen again.  Whatever the enchantments the wild mage scrawled on the axe did, it causes the haft to be the first to strike an opponent, doing crushing damage instead of slashing damage. \r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nDamage:  1d6 + 1\r\nAttack Bonus:  +1 \r\nEnchantment:  +1\r\nDamage Type:  Melee (bludgeoning)\r\nDamage Type:  Missile (bludgeoning)\r\nSpecial:\r\n  Returning: Returns to wielder\r\nWeight: 3 lb.\r\nRequired Feat:  Martial Weapon, Axe\r\nType:  One-handed",

      "Text": "There is little doubt that Dullcobble Tweed was the worst carpenter in the history of the profession, and an even worse weaponsmith, but his continual boasts of his great skill and insight eventually caused his fellows to challenge him to make a throwing axe worthy of his boastful claims.  Dullcobble, realizing he had to back his proud words, agreed heartily... but inside, he was struck with fear that he would fail the test.\r\n\r\nDullcobble made several attempts to fashion a chopping axe, most of them ending up as cordwood next to his fireplace.  In the day before his challenge was to be called due, his only surviving weapon was a lop-sided axe whose haft was widely overbalanced. Realizing that displaying such a weapon would make him the laughing stock of the community, Dullcobble hired a wild mage to take his misshapen axe and turn it into a serviceable weapon.  The mage shrugged, took his payment, and promised the axe to Dullcobble on the dawn of the next day.  When Dullcobble woke up in the morning, the misshapen axe lay on his doorstep, unchanged, and he had no choice but to take the axe to his challengers... and take his chances. \r\n\r\nWhen Dullcobble brought it into the town's meeting hall, the axe's appearance was greeted with derision and laughter.  Dullcobble, his face burning, became so angry he threw it at his tormenters - and watched as the haft traveled over the blade's head to smash into a pillar and shatter it, causing the roof to collapse.  Dullcobble, slack-jawed with surprise, was knocked unconscious by a falling timber, but the other challengers made it outside without injury.  \r\n\r\nDullcobble's blow to the head was a serious one, and it turned him into the village idiot - not much of a change from his previous lifestyle.  The axe itself was tossed upon a merchant cart headed north, and it was never seen again.  Whatever the enchantments the wild mage scrawled on the axe did, it causes the haft to be the first to strike an opponent, doing crushing damage instead of slashing damage. \r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nDamage:  1d6 + 1\r\nAttack Bonus:  +1 \r\nEnchantment:  +1\r\nDamage Type:  Melee (bludgeoning)\r\nDamage Type:  Missile (bludgeoning)\r\nSpecial:\r\n  Returning: Returns to wielder\r\nWeight: 3 lb.\r\nRequired Feat:  Martial Weapon, Axe\r\nType:  One-handed",

    "Text": "When the venerable (and senile) red dragon Craum Straug wandered into the logging camp of Hornhollow at the edge of Wood of Sharp Teeth, the residents (wisely) fled in fear as the dragon began to belch flames, setting the camp on fire and causing cries of alarm to spread throughout the countryside.  After the residents fled, Craum squatted his old bones down upon the blackened buildings, grumbling to himself and snorting flames from his nostrils. \r\n\r\nA few hours and several miles away, the residents of Hornhollow finally decided that someone must go negotiate with the dragon and see what it wanted.  When no volunteers were forthcoming, a lottery was conducted - and the loser, a traveling ministrel, Aznee Fraystrings, was given the dangerous task of attempting to deal with the dragon.  Aznee had lived out his welcome in the camp many nights previous, and the loggers considered it no great loss if Aznee gained a new home in the dragon's belly.\r\n\r\nAznee, somewhat absent-minded but of a brave heart, stumbled his way into the camp, and finally mustered the courage to speak with the dragon.  During the (now-famous) exchange that followed, Aznee discovered that Craum, who was somewhat far along in dragon years and in none too good health, was suffering the draconic equivalent of a bad cough, and his hacking and wheezing masked his plaintive attempts to try and find someone, anyone, who could help cure his fits of coughing.  \r\n\r\nSeeing a solution, Aznee offered a cure that helped an elderly uncle of his - a sprig of Maiden's Milk flower, that when crushed and administered in a tea, helped quell coughing in a matter of minutes.  Some could undoubtably be found in the forest nearby, Aznee exclaimed, and he set about gathering up several sprigs and preparing them for the dragon.  After lumping them into a great pot, he administered the steaming cauldron to the dragon.\r\n\r\nIt is suspected that either Craug drank the mixture too fast, or else Aznee had mistaken Bellows Root for Maiden's Milk, but whatever the reason, Craug vomited the mixture back out a few seconds later, setting fire to several acres of the wood and torching poor Aznee where he stood.  After this vomitus belch, Craug ran wild for almost an hour, trying to spit out the remainder of the concoction.  At the end of his rampage, the venerable red dragon fell over dead, the sudden flurry of activity more than his old bones could stand. \r\n\r\nWhen the loggers came to break down the dragon a day later, they discovered that Craum's bones still carried echoes of his coughing fits, and his entire skeleton creaked and wheezed, even after death.  They struck a deal with a local mage, who bought the dragon's bones and fashioned a series of musical instruments with them, dubbed the \"Pipes of the Wheezing Dragon.\"  These yellow bone pipes are famous throughout the Realms and, when used by a bard, they can be used to spit bursts of flames at opponents.  Unfortunately, even when not in use, the pipes tend to creak and wheeze, attracting the attention of anyone nearby and making attempts at stealth and pick pocketing useless. \r\n\r\nA thin cord made of dragon gut is strung through the pipes, so they can be worn around the neck and can be easily played when danger threatens.  The cord looks charred, as if it was burned recently, and is surprisingly tough.     \r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nSpecial: \r\n  Can cast Burning Hands 3/Day\r\n  Can cast Agannazar's Scorcher 1/Day\r\n  Pick Pocket skill: -3\r\n  Move Silently skill: -3\r\n  Hide skill: -3\r\nWeight: 1 lb.",

      "Text": "When the venerable (and senile) red dragon Craum Straug wandered into the logging camp of Hornhollow at the edge of Wood of Sharp Teeth, the residents (wisely) fled in fear as the dragon began to belch flames, setting the camp on fire and causing cries of alarm to spread throughout the countryside.  After the residents fled, Craum squatted his old bones down upon the blackened buildings, grumbling to himself and snorting flames from his nostrils. \r\n\r\nA few hours and several miles away, the residents of Hornhollow finally decided that someone must go negotiate with the dragon and see what it wanted.  When no volunteers were forthcoming, a lottery was conducted - and the loser, a traveling ministrel, Aznee Fraystrings, was given the dangerous task of attempting to deal with the dragon.  Aznee had lived out his welcome in the camp many nights previous, and the loggers considered it no great loss if Aznee gained a new home in the dragon's belly.\r\n\r\nAznee, somewhat absent-minded but of a brave heart, stumbled his way into the camp, and finally mustered the courage to speak with the dragon.  During the (now-famous) exchange that followed, Aznee discovered that Craum, who was somewhat far along in dragon years and in none too good health, was suffering the draconic equivalent of a bad cough, and his hacking and wheezing masked his plaintive attempts to try and find someone, anyone, who could help cure his fits of coughing.  \r\n\r\nSeeing a solution, Aznee offered a cure that helped an elderly uncle of his - a sprig of Maiden's Milk flower, that when crushed and administered in a tea, helped quell coughing in a matter of minutes.  Some could undoubtably be found in the forest nearby, Aznee exclaimed, and he set about gathering up several sprigs and preparing them for the dragon.  After lumping them into a great pot, he administered the steaming cauldron to the dragon.\r\n\r\nIt is suspected that either Craug drank the mixture too fast, or else Aznee had mistaken Bellows Root for Maiden's Milk, but whatever the reason, Craug vomited the mixture back out a few seconds later, setting fire to several acres of the wood and torching poor Aznee where he stood.  After this vomitus belch, Craug ran wild for almost an hour, trying to spit out the remainder of the concoction.  At the end of his rampage, the venerable red dragon fell over dead, the sudden flurry of activity more than his old bones could stand. \r\n\r\nWhen the loggers came to break down the dragon a day later, they discovered that Craum's bones still carried echoes of his coughing fits, and his entire skeleton creaked and wheezed, even after death.  They struck a deal with a local mage, who bought the dragon's bones and fashioned a series of musical instruments with them, dubbed the \"Pipes of the Wheezing Dragon.\"  These yellow bone pipes are famous throughout the Realms and, when used by a bard, they can be used to spit bursts of flames at opponents.  Unfortunately, even when not in use, the pipes tend to creak and wheeze, attracting the attention of anyone nearby and making attempts at stealth and pick pocketing useless. \r\n\r\nA thin cord made of dragon gut is strung through the pipes, so they can be worn around the neck and can be easily played when danger threatens.  The cord looks charred, as if it was burned recently, and is surprisingly tough.     \r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nSpecial: \r\n  Can cast Burning Hands 3/Day\r\n  Can cast Agannazar's Scorcher 1/Day\r\n  Pick Pocket skill: -3\r\n  Move Silently skill: -3\r\n  Hide skill: -3\r\nWeight: 1 lb.",

    "Text": "This belt is broad and thick, crafted from some otherworldly creature's hide and bound with strips of burnished copper.  Gleaming eerily from the center of the belt is a circular piece of polished green and cream malachite.  The emblem shows, in bas-relief, a fanged, winged serpent with its open mouth facing outward.  Small, thick copper loops run between the thick hide and the stone emblem to hold it in place.  Two thick steel buckles hold the belt together at the back of the wearer.\r\n\r\nInvestigation reveals that this belt was made four hundred years ago for Factor Dom, a warden for the outer-planar Mercykillers faction.  Known throughout the planes for their vicious definition and application of justice, the Mercykillers are strongest in planar cities like Sigil, the City of Doors.\r\n\r\nDom was a warden of the Prison, Sigil's dumping ground for criminals.  He became legendary within the organization after his involvement in the Great Break.  Members of the rebellious Free League engineered the only mass escape from the Prison in its history.  Over one hundred prisoners managed to get out of the Prison and escape the Lady's Ward, though hundreds more were turned back to their cells or died in their escape.  Dom was stripped of his Factor rank in the Mercykillers for failing to stop the revolt.  In addition, he spent five years in the Prison himself.  When he was set free, he set out on a thirty-year quest to bring every escaped criminal to justice.  By the time Dom had captured, killed, or verified as dead eighty of the one hundred criminals, the remaining twenty banded together to evade him.\r\n\r\nWhen Dom reached the age of sixty-seven, he had this belt made for him to augment his failing strength.  Three years later, he finally captured the last of the prisoners and brought them, kicking and screaming, all the way back to the cell from which they had escaped thirty years earlier.  Dom reported to the current warden, filled out the appropriate paperwork, and fell dead from exhaustion within the hour.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nStrength: +2\r\nWeight: 3 lb.",

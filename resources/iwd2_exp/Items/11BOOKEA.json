    "Text": "Easthaven gained certain notoriety in the past many years after the terrible events that occurred there in 1281 DR, the Year of the Cold Soul, and it is the events that plagued the town that drew many historians, seers, and mages to the region seeking to know more of the Ten-Towns and the North.  This tome is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to the Ten-Towns nor detail the terrible events that occurred in the Year of the Cold Soul, its intention has been written merely to familiarize the reader with the people and day-to-day life in Easthaven. \r\n\r\nThe town of Easthaven is one of the \"Ten Towns\" in the region known as Icewind Dale.  However, \"town\" may be a bit misleading for such a small frontier community as Easthaven - at least by southern standards.  Although it has experienced a surge of growth in the past few years, Easthaven is little more than a half-moon of modest dwellings clustered around the shores of the icy Lac Dinneshere.  The primary industry of Easthaven is the exportation of scrimshaw, a highly sought after craft material obtained from the bones of knucklehead trout, and visitors should not be surprised to find that the overall atmosphere of the town can be summed up as a snowy, frontier fishing village.  The buildings of the town are built primarily of timber, and the feel of the town reflects the hearts of the townspeople - nearly everything has a rugged feel to it, somewhat unrefined yet sturdy enough to withstand the harsh climate.  Scattered across the town is tremendous evidence of the town's fishing industry; nets, boats, fish racks litter the town in great abundance.\r\n\r\nEasthaven has been forced to rebuild over the past few years after the terrible events in the Year of the Cold Soul.  The Temple of Tempus has been rebuilt, although the relics that were stored within the basement of the temple have been moved south in accordance with the mandate of the high priests of Tempus.  Treasure-seekers or fortune hunters who come to Easthaven hoping to find some of the lost relics or arcane items believed to have left behind should be prepared for disappointment as the snows have been picked clean by visiting mages and thieves over the past twenty or thirty years.  Any scholars or explorers coming to the region should make sure to visit the town of Kuldahar to see the great oak in its splendor.  \r\n\r\nDespite many attempts to locate them, there have been no documented sightings of the aquatic elves rumored to live in the depths of Lac Dinneshere.  It is the author's opinion that the existence of these elves is merely one of the local myths intended to draw traders and settlers to the region. \r\n\r\nWeight:  1 lb.",

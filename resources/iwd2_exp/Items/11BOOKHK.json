    "Text": "The tiny valley of Kuldahar is nestled within the mountain range known as the Spine of the World, which is situated on the northern expanse of the continent of Faerun.  Its jagged, snow-capped peaks stretch from the Sword Coast in the west all the way east to the Anauroch Desert, separating the northern region known as Icewind Dale from the warmer and more \"civilized\" lands to the south.  Traditionally, access to Icewind Dale is limited to the caravan route that snakes from the frontier city of Luskan, around the western edge of the Spine of the World, and across the frozen tundra surrounding the Ten Towns of the Dale.  However, there exists another route, Kuldahar Pass, that is less traveled due to the inherent dangers of its geography.  \r\n\r\nThe route through Kuldahar Pass consists of narrow and winding footpaths, barely wide enough to accommodate pack animals let alone caravan wagons.  The steep, snowy ledges of the pass provide enough of an obstacle to deter even the most enterprising of merchants.  Factor in the ever-present danger from giants and other denizens of the untamed mountain range, and it's a wonder anyone travels the route at all.  Those that do brave the route (and manage to survive) can find a small, secluded valley situated at the heart of the mountain pass.  In the center of the valley, in a cold and desolate place where plants and other foliage have no earthly business existing, juts a massive tree over three hundred feet tall.  The tree itself is a holy shrine of Silvanus, the Oak Father, the God of Nature and patron deity of Druids.  It was he who planted the seed and nurtured this giant oak thousands of years ago when Faerun was first born.  The shrine was intended to stand as a testament to the raw power of nature, a monument to its ability to thrive in the face of adversity.  For generations the devout followers of Silvanus have tended to the tree, and eventually the shrine became an oracle of sorts, a mystic site where druids throughout the realms could come and seek insight and revelations that would bring them closer to understanding the harmony between nature and man.  It was not until the past thirty to forty years that explorers first discovered the Pass and, subsequently, the little valley that housed this massive tree.  Tales soon began to spread about the unusual warm weather in this hidden valley, warmth that seemed to emanate from the tree itself.  It was only a matter of time before settlers began to arrive, seeking to build homes in a place that was obviously so close to the Gods.  \r\n\r\nAt first, the druids sought to protect the holy site from the settlers.  The Archdruid in charge of the shrine at the time saw the settlers as an affront to the sanctity and seclusion of the site.  For years the druids kept the settlers at bay with barriers of thorny brambles and various druid tricks that kept the common folk in fear of the place.  Ultimately, their efforts were in vain.  Despite the druids' success at keeping the settlers away from the tree itself, they still would not leave the valley.  It wasn't until the succession of Archdruid Tolben, that the situation in Kuldahar Valley finally changed.  Tolben, unlike his predecessors, believed that the settlement of the valley was not only inevitable, but it was actually the will of Silvanus.  He believed that druids had been wrong in keeping the settlers away and that the Oak Father had intended people to share in the miracle of the Great Oak from the beginning.  When he finally became Archdruid, he formed a plan to fulfill the destiny of the sacred site by bringing about a union between the Great Oak and the settlers.  It was this union that the Archdruid Tolben believed would achieve the harmony the druids had been striving for generations: the harmony between man and nature.  As it stands, Kuldahar is a monument to this vision.  The tree and town exist in a natural symbiosis where it is next to impossible to tell where one leaves off and the other begins.\r\n\r\nAs with the small fishing town of Easthaven, Kuldahar became the focus of the terrible war that raged in 1281 DR, the Year of the Cold Soul.  Great storms raged across the region, cutting off the Pass, and the circle of warmth around the great oak receded, forcing many of the inhabitants of Kuldahar Valley to abandon their homes and take refuge within the town.  Until Hrothgar's expedition from Easthaven finally arrived to rescue the town from the forces brewing in the Spine of the World Mountains, it seemed that the great oak would be destroyed and the town of Kuldahar would be buried in the great snows blanketing the region. \r\n\r\nToday, Hrothgar's body is said to lie buried in a glen within Kuldahar Pass.  The names of the heroes that traveled with him and saved Kuldahar have long since been lost, but their deeds live on, evidence of the persistence and strength of the people of the North.\r\n\r\nWeight:  1 lb.",

    "Text": "If it had not been for the rise of the barbarian king Wylfdene thirty years past and the terrible events surrounding his campaign against the Ten-Towns, Lonelywood would most likely have been forgotten by most of the North.  Straddling the rocky shores of Maer Dualdon and the alpine forest of Lonely Wood from which the town borrowed its name, Lonelywood has the dubious honor of being the northernmost settlement in all of Faerun.  The town lies in the shadow of Kelvin's Cairn, and the solitary mountain peak acts as a barrier that shelters both the town and forest against the harsh winds that blow down from the Reghed Glacier.  Although the town is protected from the wind, the weather is hardly temperate.  Snow still covers the ground nearly year around, and at night the temperature drops below freezing.\r\n\r\nLonelywood is one of the youngest of the Ten-Towns.  It was only in recent years that it was recognized by the council as the tenth town.  Eighty years ago, there was nothing in the way of civilized settlements north of Termalaine and the area surrounding the Lonely Wood was rife with logger camps and lone trappers.  With the establishment of the Whistling Gallows Inn, however, Lonelywood gained a sense of permanency, and a small town slowly grew up around the Inn.\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, commerce in Lonelywood revolves around lumber.  The Lonely Wood is the only respectable forest in all of Icewind Dale (hence the name, Lonely Wood), and all the lumber and byproduct in the Ten-Towns not imported from the south originates from Lonelywood.  Unfortunately, the vast majority of wood is imported from the south, which explains why Lonelywood remains such a coarse and isolated community.\r\n\r\nIts isolated position in the North makes Lonelywood vulnerable to attacks from the barbarian tribes that dwell in the icy plains surrounding the Ten-Towns.  It was the first of the towns in the path of the barbarian king Wylfdene and the united tribes of the Bear, the Elk, and the Great Whale in their campaign to drive the townsman from the North.  When Wylfdene was defeated by a band of adventurers from Kuldahar, the tribes scattered, and Lonelywood returned to its day-to-day routines not long afterwards. \r\n\r\nThe Whistling Gallows still stands to this day, and the tree outside the Inn has become a post for travelers to carve their names into when they stay the night in Lonelywood. \r\n\r\nWeight:  1 lb.",

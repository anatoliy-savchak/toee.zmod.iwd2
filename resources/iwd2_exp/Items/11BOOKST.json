It is something of a intriguing thought to consider what would have happened had Larrel's attempt to lay the Mythal had succeeded, but such speculations can be linked to other speculations concerning the fall of the fortress, including the severed ties with the dwarves of Dorn's Deep, and the growing mistrust between the two races in the face of the threat the horde represented to the two kingdoms and of the North.  It cannot be forgotten that, if taken in perspective, even though it cost of the lives of his people, Larrel succeeded in his goals, for the Mythal served to break the back of the Horde's thrust into the Spine of the World.\r\n\r\nIt is the theory and practice of the Mythal that intrigues me and many other scholars to this day.  Was it arrogance that led Larrel to believe he could cast such a powerful enchantment believed to be possible only with several archmages working in unison, or was it *truly* possible, and it was only the presence of the Horde within the halls of the Severed Hand that led the enchantment astray? When I first came to the North it was to seek out the Severed Hand and find the remnants of Larrel's work, but it wasn't until a band of glory seekers from Easthaven traveling the region found the ruined elven fortress for me and retrieved a tome from its library that I was truly able to embark upon my research.  After confirming that the adventurers had made it safe to walk the halls of the fortress again, I abandoned my tower in Kuldahar to the elements, set Weenog on his way (with instructions to return to his tribe and cause no mischief), and traveled northwards to the fortress.\" \r\n\r\nThe last paragraph in the book has been marked in red ink, but there is no note indicating why it was highlighted.  \r\n\r\nWeight:  1 lb.",

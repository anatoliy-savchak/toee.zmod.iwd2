    "Text": "The region of Icewind Dale is commonly considered to be the land that lies north of the Spine of the World that has not (yet) been covered by the Reghed Glacier.  The name Icewind Dale stems from the great storms that lash the region, storms that strike with such strength and viciousness that they can level buildings and carry away anything not tied down.  The weather aside, the region is made more inhospitable by the yetis that roam the tundra, along with the great frost giants, polar worms, and winter wolves that inhabit the region in great numbers.  It is frequently said that no sane man travels to Icewind Dale, for it is not the place for civilized folk.  During the past many years, however, it has been a lodestone for explorers, greedy rogues, and hardy souls that seek to start a new life far from the southern kingdoms of Faerun, and it has attracted some of the greatest adventurers known in the history of the Realms.  To say that it also attracts its share of men on the run from the \"restrictive\" laws of the south would not be inaccurate, and in recent years, in light of the troubles that occurred in the Ten-Towns of Easthaven and Lonelywood, it has also drawn its share of fortune-seekers, treasure hunters, sages, and historians, all of whom are seeking to exploit the history and past conflicts of the region for their own interests.  Many of them do not survive to return home, and ill-prepared curiosity seekers should steer clear of Icewind Dale.\r\n\r\nThe signposts of civilization in Icewind Dale can be found in a collection of frontier settlements called the Ten-Towns, which are clustered around the three lakes in the region: Maer Dualdon, Lac Dinneshere, and Redwaters.  The waters of these lakes are home to a rare species of fish known as the knucklehead trout, which thrive in the icy waters of the lakes and provide the Towns with their main industry: fishing.  The knucklehead trout are known for their great fist-sized heads, and their bones are of such a white hue (and rare enough) to command a price to rival that of the ivory from the jungles of Chult.  Scrimshanders, artisans who carve the heads of the knucklehead trout into sculptures and works of art, are highly respected in Icewind Dale, and there is a great demand for their works as far south as Baldur's Gate. \r\n\r\nIf the Ten-Towns has a heart, it is the walled town of Bryn Shander (one of the only two towns of the Ten that are walled, the other being Targos), and this town is the destination of most travelers in Icewind Dale - or at least those who have no interest in the fishing trade.  A narrow trail called the Eastway leads from Bryn Shander to the shores of Lac Dinneshere, where one can find the towns of Caer-Dineval and Caer-Konig on its western flank, and the fishing community of Easthaven to the south.  Of these, Easthaven has gained the most notoriety over the past years, most likely due to its role in the conflict that struck the region in the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR and sealed off the town from its brothers.\r\n\r\nThe smallest of the three lakes in the region, Redwaters, is the lake that lies to the south of Lac Dinneshere.  It takes its name from the battle waged on the tundra where the towns of Good Mead and Dougan's Hold now stand.  To the west and north is Maer Dualdon, the largest of the three lakes in the region, and the home of the remaining four towns of Icewind Dale that cluster about its shores: Termalaine, Targos, Bremen, and Lonelywood.  The town of Termalaine is widely regarded as the most beautiful of the settlements, with trees planted within the town and walls built around the homes to shield them from the wind.  The town of Bremen lies at the outflow of the river that drains Maer Dualdon into the Shaengarne River and not surprisingly, its position results in a steady stream of barbarians, river traders, and merchants.  South of Bremen lies the walled cliff town of Targos, known for its impressive port (for the region), and the standing Targos Guard, one of the largest forces in Icewind Dale.  The last and northernmost of the Ten-Towns, the logging community of Lonelywood, is known primarily for its logging industry.  Like Easthaven, Lonelywood has also experienced its share of troubles in the past thirty years, and it was feared that the town would be lost when the barbarians began their campaign against the Ten-Towns under the leadership of the barbarian lord Wylfdene in the Year of the Cold Soul.  Despite this threat to the region, Lonelywood survived, and even prospered, growing to export lumber throughout the region. \r\n\r\nLast among the signposts of the region, the great peak of Kelvin's Cairn can be found squatting midway between Lac Dinneshere and Maer Dualdon.  According to Uthgart legends, Kelvin's Cairn takes its name from the fallen frost giant Kelvin Duarol, who was slain by the god Tempus.  As a warning, Tempus is said to have pulled huge rocks from the plain and piled them atop his foe, both to mark his victory and to warn others of what will befall them should they attempt to cross the God of War.  This is one of the many holy sites of Tempus that lie within Icewind Dale, and it is the reason that many priests and temples of Tempus can be found throughout the North. \r\n\r\nWeight:  1 lb.",

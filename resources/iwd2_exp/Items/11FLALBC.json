    "Text": "This heavy flail is composed of an iron rod with three hollow metal tubes secured to it by thin black iron chains.  When held, the chimes ring together, as if stirred by the wind, and no amount of padding or wrapping seems to silence the flail's chiming.  When swung in combat, the chimes clash like thunder, having a chance of deafening anyone struck by it. \r\n\r\nThis weapon is all that remains of Slow Cedric's Gallop, a small frontier settlement located in the Southern Pass of the Spine of the World Mountains.  The settlement is believed to have been overrun by a tribe of orcs in the great winter of 1170 DR, and when the cold season passed, the settlement and the bodies of the townsfolk had been buried beneath great mountains of snow.  When the first travelers braved the Pass in the spring season, they found only the top of the settlement's great stone belltower peeking through the mountainous drifts.  This odd-looking flail was found lying upon the tower's bloodied stone floor, surrounded by the frost-dusted bodies of several dead orcs. \r\n\r\nAccording to tales, the Black Chimes were a symbol of office of the settlement's Bell Warden, whose duty was two-fold - to ring the warning bell when an enemy was sighted in the pass, and after the warning bell had been rung, to defend the pass with his life.  It is believed the first Bell Warden of Slow Cedric's Gallop was the original creator of the Black Chimes, an enchanted flail that would ring to warn the town of danger at the same time as he leapt into battle against his foes. \r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nDamage:  1d8\r\nAttack Bonus:  +1 \r\nEnchantment;  +1\r\nDamage Type:  Bludgeoning\r\nSpecial:  \r\n  For the purposes of hitting enchanted creatures this weapon is considered a +1 weapon\r\n  25% chance target is Deafened (Fortitude save negates)\r\n  Penalty:  -1 to Move Silently skill\r\nWeight: 5 lb.\r\nRequired Feat:  Martial Weapon, Flail\r\nType:  One-handed\r\n",

      "Text": "This heavy flail is composed of an iron rod with three hollow metal tubes secured to it by thin black iron chains.  When held, the chimes ring together, as if stirred by the wind, and no amount of padding or wrapping seems to silence the flail's chiming.  When swung in combat, the chimes clash like thunder, having a chance of deafening anyone struck by it. \r\n\r\nThis weapon is all that remains of Slow Cedric's Gallop, a small frontier settlement located in the Southern Pass of the Spine of the World Mountains.  The settlement is believed to have been overrun by a tribe of orcs in the great winter of 1170 DR, and when the cold season passed, the settlement and the bodies of the townsfolk had been buried beneath great mountains of snow.  When the first travelers braved the Pass in the spring season, they found only the top of the settlement's great stone belltower peeking through the mountainous drifts.  This odd-looking flail was found lying upon the tower's bloodied stone floor, surrounded by the frost-dusted bodies of several dead orcs. \r\n\r\nAccording to tales, the Black Chimes were a symbol of office of the settlement's Bell Warden, whose duty was two-fold - to ring the warning bell when an enemy was sighted in the pass, and after the warning bell had been rung, to defend the pass with his life.  It is believed the first Bell Warden of Slow Cedric's Gallop was the original creator of the Black Chimes, an enchanted flail that would ring to warn the town of danger at the same time as he leapt into battle against his foes. \r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nDamage:  1d8\r\nAttack Bonus:  +1 \r\nEnchantment;  +1\r\nDamage Type:  Bludgeoning\r\nSpecial:  \r\n  For the purposes of hitting enchanted creatures this weapon is considered a +1 weapon\r\n  25% chance target is Deafened (Fortitude save negates)\r\n  Penalty:  -1 to Move Silently skill\r\nWeight: 5 lb.\r\nRequired Feat:  Martial Weapon, Flail\r\nType:  One-handed\r\n",

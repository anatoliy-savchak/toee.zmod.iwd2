    "Text": "This letter is written on parchment in a strong, brisk hand.  The text is brief and to the point, as follows:\r\n\r\nTargos: Three or fewer ships, perhaps a few dozen infantry and archers.  Two priests at the temple pavilion, with recruits drawn in from Luskan.  The goblin's seizure of the waterways seems to have closed off the passage of further reinforcements.  I have heard no mention of planned reinforcements from elsewhere into the city.  The diviner in Targos should be taken care of by our friends from Luskan.\r\n\r\nBremen: The city should fall soon.  Targos is unable to move ships across the bay thanks to our scrag allies.  According to wounded soldiers from Bremen, they will not be able to hold out.  You should be able to pull in forces from the north without worrying about attacks from Bremen.\r\n\r\nBryn Shander: With our forces in the field and the Shaengarne Ford held, the capital is unable to effectively provide the peripheral towns with supplies.  The bugbears' use of hit and run tactics against caravans moving between the Ten-Towns has made it almost impossible for them to reinforce each other.  Lonelywood has sent almost all of its able-bodied men south to Bryn Shander instead of sending them to Targos.  The same has happened in Easthaven.  Both towns should be ripe for taking should we choose to enlarge our grasp of the region.  Perhaps three to four hundred men wait in Bryn Shander along with a handful of volunteers from Clan Battlehammer.  Most of those are militia, with a few experienced mercenaries among them.  We need not worry about Silverymoon and the other communities to the east.  Only two volunteers have arrived, and those are already out of the action.\r\n\r\nWeight: 0 lb.",

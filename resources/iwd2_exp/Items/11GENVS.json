    "Text": "Thank the gods your band numbers a Luskan cutpurse.  I see you doubt this note was intended for your band - do not.  I divined that you would sail in on the Wicked Wench and would make your way here to the Pavilion, and one of your number would search my pockets while I lay here.  \r\n\r\nIn a short while, I shall attempt to use the Sight to determine the location of the goblin fortress, and I am writing this note out of fear that obtaining a vision of such a place may tax my spirit greatly, preventing me from returning to the waking world.  I have not told the Lady Elytharra of my attempt at divination, for she would surely stop me... and if any others were to know my intentions, they might seek to poison me, for I fear there are traitors within the town that even now turn their eyes to my destruction.  For now, my safety - and Targos' safety - lies in silence. \r\n\r\nIf you're reading this and I still breathe, then it's not too late to awaken me.  Now that you have found this scroll, I need you to find a flask of braehg which you can purchase from a river trader named Guthewulfe in the Salty Dog Tavern.  He should have brought some weapons and other supplies from Shaengarne, but among his inventory will be a flask of braehg which you may purchase.*  Bring it to me and place a single drop on my tongue, and within a few minutes, I should awaken from my stupor.\r\n\r\nPlease make haste.  I will reward you for your efforts, of course, and even cast your fortunes should you desire it.  The reward and my castings will not be forthcoming until I regain consciousness, however.\r\n\r\n* (Something about \"picking Guthewulfe's pockets as you did mine,\" looks like it was scrawled here, but it looks like Valin had second thoughts and scratched it out.)\r\n\r\nWeight: 0 lb.",

    "Text": "This barely recognizable lump of fish bone has been carried as good luck charm in Targos for almost twenty years.  The item's history started with the sailor Young Ned of Lonelywood.  On one of his fishing trips near Targos, his small boat capsized near the Maer Dualdon shore.  He held onto his prize catch, an \"unbelievably massive\" knucklehead trout, despite being charged by a hungry bear when he reached shore.  The bear snatched the majority of the trout away from Ned, leaving him holding the poor fish's tooth-severed head.  Ned walked the rest of the way to Targos and kept the head as evidence of his encounter.  Over time, Ned started to attribute his good fortune as a sailor to his \"lucky knucky\".  The brigand Marg the Trembler \"won\" Ned's lucky knucky away from him in a rigged card game.  Ned was bitter over being cheated, but he wasn't willing to stand up to Marg to get it back.  Marg later used the fish head as currency to buy supplies as he hastily fled from Targos.  The man who received the piece of bone held on to it for a few months before handing it off to a friend at the docks.  In the years that followed up to the current date, Ned's \"lucky knucky\" has been traded, won, or sold to over a dozen people in Targos and, once, in Bremen.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nLuck: +2\r\nSaving Throw Bonus: +2 to all saving throws\r\nWeight: 0 lb.",

    "Text": "The Heart of Winter is often confused with the legendary Heartstone Gem, a powerful scrying artifact that serves as the heart of the great tree community of Kuldahar.  The Heart of Winter is not an object, but an expression frequently used by the Uthgart tribes of the north to refer to a warrior or creature that has rid itself of all except one driving focus - usually revenge or hatred.  The expression is often used to describe the barbarian lord, Wylfdene, who returned to lead the barbarian tribes in a campaign against the Ten-Towns in the Year of the Cold Soul (1281 Dale Reckoning).  According to legend, Wylfdene claimed to be the reincarnation of the shaman Jerrod, one of the barbarians greatest heroes and the one who sacrificed himself in the final battle against the archmage Arakon many hundreds of years ago.  Claiming that his body had become home to Jerrod's spirit, Wylfdene rallied the tribes of the North to war to retake the lands that he claimed had been seized by the southerners of the Ten-Towns.  Establishing a great war camp in Bremen's Run, a narrow canyon under the shadow of Kelvin's Cairn, he fought several quick battles against the dwarves and townsfolk of the region until a small band of adventurers arrived in the town of Lonelywood to try to carve out a peace between the Ten-Towns and the barbarians.  Their efforts at diplomacy are said to have failed, but they succeeded in defeating Wylfdene and saving the Ten-Towns from destruction.  It is believed that these adventurers are the only reason the Ten-Towns exist (and thrive) to this day. \r\n\r\nWhat happened to these brave adventurers is unknown.  The last known record of them is a sighting of them at the Whistling Gallows Inn in Lonelywood, where they spoke with a halfling traveler who claimed to know of a place where great riches could be found.  Shortly after this, the adventurers and the halfling vanished and were never heard from again. \r\n\r\nAfter reading the closing chapter of the book above, you notice that the top letter in each of the chapters weave together to form a peculiar summoning spell.  When a passage is recited from the book, it allows the reader to inflict the curse of the Heart of Winter upon foes, blinding them with its power or even freezing them where they stand.  \r\n\r\nSTATISTICS\r\n\r\nSpell Power: Cast Otiluke's Freezing Sphere 3/Day\r\nSpell Power: Cast Power Word: Blindness 3/Day\r\n\r\nWeight: 1 lb.",

Claiming that his body had become home to Jerrod's spirit, Wylfdene rallied the tribes of the North to war to retake the lands that he claimed had been seized by the southerners of the Ten-Towns.  Establishing a great war camp in Bremen's Run, a narrow canyon under the shadow of Kelvin's Cairn, he fought several quick battles against the dwarves and townsfolk of the region until a small band of adventurers arrived in the town of Lonelywood to try to carve out a peace between the Ten-Towns and the barbarians.  Their efforts at diplomacy are said to have failed, but they succeeded in defeating Wylfdene and saving the Ten-Towns from destruction.  It is believed that these adventurers are the only reason the Ten-Towns exist (and thrive) to this day. \r\n\r\nWhat happened to these brave adventurers is unknown.  The last known record of them is a sighting of them at the Whistling Gallows Inn in Lonelywood, where they spoke with a halfling traveler who claimed to know of a place where great riches could be found.  Shortly after this, the adventurers and the halfling vanished and were never heard from again. \r\n\r\nAfter reading the closing chapter of the book above, you notice that the top letter in each of the chapters weave together to form a peculiar summoning spell.  When a passage is recited from the book, it allows the reader to inflict the curse of the Heart of Winter upon foes, blinding them with its power or even freezing them where they stand.  \r\n\r\nSTATISTICS\r\n\r\nSpell Power: Cast Otiluke's Freezing Sphere 3/Day\r\nSpell Power: Cast Power Word: Blindness 3/Day\r\n\r\nWeight: 1 lb.",

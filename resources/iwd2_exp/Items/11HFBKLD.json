    "Text": "The greatest legends can stem from the humblest beginnings, and so it was with the band of adventurers that began their journey in the fishing community of Easthaven thirty years ago, 1281 Dale Reckoning.  Meeting in the Winter's Cradle Tavern, this band of southerners had traveled north in search of adventure, and they were the first to join Hrothgar's expedition to investigate the rumor of troubles brewing in the great tree town of Kuldahar to the North, where a mighty oak, towering hundreds of feet high, sheltered a small town beneath its boughs with a life-giving warmth.\r\n\r\nThe misfortunes plaguing Icewind Dale led to the ambush of Hrothgar's expedition in the windswept Kuldahar Pass... and it left them the only survivors.  Pressing on against goblinoid raiders that filled the Pass, the small band finally reached Kuldahar, only to discover the great tree was being threatened by an unknown evil deep within the mountains - if this evil was not stopped, Kuldahar would be destroyed, and the North itself might soon share the town's fate. \r\n\r\nThe brave band of adventurers searched out this evil, their travels carrying them from the crypts of the Vale of Shadows through the numerous ruins of the North, including the decaying elven fortress of the Severed Hand and the lava-filled caverns of Dragon's Eye.  Much of their journey has been lost, but there is no doubt that their efforts led to the salvation of Kuldahar and the Ten-Towns and their deeds are still spoken of in Easthaven and Kuldahar to this day.  Hrothgar himself has been laid to rest in a small glen near the town of Kuldahar, in memory of his selflessness in coming to the aid of his neighbor in a time when Easthaven itself was suffering troubles of its own. \r\n\r\nAmong their other acts of heroism, the adventurers are credited with the discovery of the location of the tomb of Kresselack the Black Wolf, one of the most infamous of the Northern generals, the discovery of the Severed Hand, and numerous other monasteries and ruins believed lost to time and the snows of the North. \r\n\r\nAfter reading the closing chapter of the book above, you notice that the top letter in each of the chapters weave together to form a peculiar summoning spell.  When a passage is recited from the book, it summons the howling winds of Icewind Dale to the reader's aid.  \r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nSpell Power: Cast Whirlwind 3 times/Day\r\nSpell Power: Cast Planar Binding: Air Elemental 3/Day\r\n\r\nWeight: 1 lb.",

      "Text": "The greatest legends can stem from the humblest beginnings, and so it was with the band of adventurers that began their journey in the fishing community of Easthaven thirty years ago, 1281 Dale Reckoning.  Meeting in the Winter's Cradle Tavern, this band of southerners had traveled north in search of adventure, and they were the first to join Hrothgar's expedition to investigate the rumor of troubles brewing in the great tree town of Kuldahar to the North, where a mighty oak, towering hundreds of feet high, sheltered a small town beneath its boughs with a life-giving warmth.\r\n\r\nThe misfortunes plaguing Icewind Dale led to the ambush of Hrothgar's expedition in the windswept Kuldahar Pass... and it left them the only survivors.  Pressing on against goblinoid raiders that filled the Pass, the small band finally reached Kuldahar, only to discover the great tree was being threatened by an unknown evil deep within the mountains - if this evil was not stopped, Kuldahar would be destroyed, and the North itself might soon share the town's fate. \r\n\r\nThe brave band of adventurers searched out this evil, their travels carrying them from the crypts of the Vale of Shadows through the numerous ruins of the North, including the decaying elven fortress of the Severed Hand and the lava-filled caverns of Dragon's Eye.  Much of their journey has been lost, but there is no doubt that their efforts led to the salvation of Kuldahar and the Ten-Towns and their deeds are still spoken of in Easthaven and Kuldahar to this day.  Hrothgar himself has been laid to rest in a small glen near the town of Kuldahar, in memory of his selflessness in coming to the aid of his neighbor in a time when Easthaven itself was suffering troubles of its own. \r\n\r\nAmong their other acts of heroism, the adventurers are credited with the discovery of the location of the tomb of Kresselack the Black Wolf, one of the most infamous of the Northern generals, the discovery of the Severed Hand, and numerous other monasteries and ruins believed lost to time and the snows of the North. \r\n\r\nAfter reading the closing chapter of the book above, you notice that the top letter in each of the chapters weave together to form a peculiar summoning spell.  When a passage is recited from the book, it summons the howling winds of Icewind Dale to the reader's aid.  \r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nSpell Power: Cast Whirlwind 3 times/Day\r\nSpell Power: Cast Planar Binding: Air Elemental 3/Day\r\n\r\nWeight: 1 lb.",

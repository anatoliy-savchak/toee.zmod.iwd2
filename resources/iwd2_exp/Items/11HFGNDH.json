    "Text": "This magical hoop looks like it belongs around a barrel, and chances are, it probably once was.  There are numerous tales (most of them false) about the hoop's origins, but the most common tale says that the hoop was born in the Elfsong Tavern in Baldur's Gate, and that it was the result of an angry wager between two men, one, a quiet wild mage by the name of Dreisbach, and the other, a passionate stevedore by the name of Geithman.  Geithman claimed that magic was no substitute for raw strength and determination, and when Dreisbach begged to differ, the bet was decided: whoever could load the most barrels into one of the port warehouses from dawn to dusk would be declared the winner.  \r\n\r\nAccording to the tale, Dreisbach fashioned the hoop in a single night, and when he arrived at the warehouse the next morning, he drew forth the hoop and spun it on the ground - with every spin, a barrel would suddenly appear in the warehouse.  Dreisbach spun the hoop for an hour, until hundreds of barrels were stacked up in the warehouse at a height several lengths of a man, so much so that Dreisbach could no longer be seen behind the walls of barrels.  Geithman could not compete with the summoned barrels, and he was about to concede the contest in disgust, when Dreisbach suddenly let out a cry, and there was a clang as the iron hoop clattered to the ground.  When Geithman and the onlookers navigated the maze of barrels to the space where Dreisbach had been standing, there was no trace of the mage.  Only the hoop remained, lying innocently on the floor. \r\n\r\nNone of those gathered to watch the outcome of the bet dared to touch the hoop.  While Dreisbach was declared the winner, every man gathered there that day conceded that Tymora had smiled upon Geithman instead.  The warehouse was quickly locked up, and the men quickly retreated to the Elfsong to talk of other things. \r\n\r\nWhere the barrels the hoop summons come from is unknown, but it is recommended that the user exercise caution in the summoning... or else the barrels will have their vengeance. \r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nSpecial: Summons a keg once per day.

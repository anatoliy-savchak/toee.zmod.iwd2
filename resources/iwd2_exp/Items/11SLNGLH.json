Almost thirty years past, a band of adventurers entered the Vale of Shadows and returned with many relics and treasures taken from the tombs there.  The Left Hand of Darkness is one such item, though its true purpose was not realized when it was discovered.  Considered nothing more than the cast-off bandage of a mummy, it had been used to wrap a gold necklace lying in one of the sarcophagi in the tombs. \r\n\r\nThe necklace's wrapping was discarded as soon as the band of adventurers returned to Kuldahar, and as they cast it away, the adventurers joked that it could serve some little boy as a sling if need be.  One of the children of Kuldahar was quick to pick up on this comment, and he kept the sling both for hunting and as a good luck charm for several years.  It is not known if he knew if the wrapping was magical or not, and he attributed the accuracy of the stones cast from it as his own natural ability rather than that of the sling.   \r\n\r\nIn truth, the Left Hand of Darkness is one of the wrappings from the left hand of one of Kresselack's lieutenants, who had been resurrected as a mummy within the tomb of his lord and served as a guardian against trespassers.  When a stone is placed within the wrapping and spun with great force, the stone will fly straight and true at an enemy.  Furthermore, as long as the wrapping is held in the hand, the wielder is immune to diseases, both magical and mundane. \r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nDamage:  +1 (missile)\r\nAttack Bonus:  +1 \r\nSpecial: Wielder is immune to Disease when equipped\r\nWeight: 0 lb.\r\nFeat Requirement:  Simple Weapon, Missile\r\nType:  One-handed",

Considered nothing more than the cast-off bandage of a mummy, it had been used to wrap a gold necklace lying in one of the sarcophagi in the tombs. \r\n\r\nThe necklace's wrapping was discarded as soon as the band of adventurers returned to Kuldahar, and as they cast it away, the adventurers joked that it could serve some little boy as a sling if need be.  One of the children of Kuldahar was quick to pick up on this comment, and he kept the sling both for hunting and as a good luck charm for several years.  It is not known if he knew if the wrapping was magical or not, and he attributed the accuracy of the stones cast from it as his own natural ability rather than that of the sling.   \r\n\r\nIn truth, the Left Hand of Darkness is one of the wrappings from the left hand of one of Kresselack's lieutenants, who had been resurrected as a mummy within the tomb of his lord and served as a guardian against trespassers.  When a stone is placed within the wrapping and spun with great force, the stone will fly straight and true at an enemy.  Furthermore, as long as the wrapping is held in the hand, the wielder is immune to diseases, both magical and mundane. \r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nDamage:  +1 (missile)\r\nAttack Bonus:  +1 \r\nSpecial: Wielder is immune to Disease when equipped\r\nWeight: 0 lb.\r\nFeat Requirement:  Simple Weapon, Missile\r\nType:  One-handed",

    "Text": "The saga of Wandering Sky is a tale of hearth and home told by many skalds of the North.  The tale exemplifies the persistence and strength of the barbarian spirit.\r\n\r\nWhen the legions of Arakon the Arch-Mage swept across Icewind Dale, the Tribe of the Bear was among the first of the tribes to meet his assault.  Overwhelmed by the superior forces, the barbarians fought bravely, but they were no match for Arakon's forces.  One of the tribe's eldest hunters and warriors, Hreidgar, was knocked unconscious during the battle, and he awoke to the sky tearing at his face and the remains of his fellows around him.  Of his wife and children, there was no trace, and without a word, Hreidgar took up his great sword and followed the path of Arakon's army, determined to reclaim them and avenge the fallen.  \r\n\r\nHreidgar was among the first to pledge his blade to the barbarian shaman Jerrod when he united the tribes against Arakon, and he served tirelessly in the great battles ahead, even on the darkest day when Arakon unleashed armies of the hells against Jerrod and the tribes.  In every battle, Hreidgar and his greatsword were as one, howling like the wind as he drove his enemies back... and to their deaths.  But when Arakon was at last defeated, no trace of Hreidgar's wife and child were to be found. \r\n\r\nHreidgar continued his search, and his journey of many years is said to have taken him across the great cliffs of the Reghed Glacier during the Season of Raining Spears, upon the Sea of Moving Ice where he sailed with the Tribe of the Great Whale and fought slavers from the south, and then to his final destination, the small town of Enholm's Point, where he stood with the handful of the town's defenders against the army of Kresselack the Black Wolf.  It is said Hreidgar fought so fiercely that Kresselack conceded the field in honor of the warrior - but not before striking the fatal blow that would end the warrior's life.\r\n\r\nBleeding from numerous wounds, Hreidgar is said to have wandered north from Enholm's Point, traveling for many miles before collapsing to his knees.  With the last of his strength, the old warrior plunged his blade into the ice and said he had finally found what he had been seeking.  \"Let the sky wander,\" he proclaimed, \"for my travels are done.\"  \r\n\r\nWhen the townsfolk of Enholm's Point returned the next day to carry his body away, they found Hreidgar, but his blade had vanished.  It is said that the blade now wanders as the sky wanders, finding its way to others with long journeys before them... and guiding them to their final destination, whatever it may be.  \r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nDamage: 2d6 + 1\r\nAttack Bonus:  +1 \r\nEnchantment:  +1\r\nDamage Type:  Slashing\r\nSpecial: \r\n  Spell Power: Can cast Doom once\r\nWeight:  12 lb.\r\nFeat Requirement:  Martial Weapon, Great Sword\r\nType:  Two-handed",

      "Text": "The saga of Wandering Sky is a tale of hearth and home told by many skalds of the North.  The tale exemplifies the persistence and strength of the barbarian spirit.\r\n\r\nWhen the legions of Arakon the Arch-Mage swept across Icewind Dale, the Tribe of the Bear was among the first of the tribes to meet his assault.  Overwhelmed by the superior forces, the barbarians fought bravely, but they were no match for Arakon's forces.  One of the tribe's eldest hunters and warriors, Hreidgar, was knocked unconscious during the battle, and he awoke to the sky tearing at his face and the remains of his fellows around him.  Of his wife and children, there was no trace, and without a word, Hreidgar took up his great sword and followed the path of Arakon's army, determined to reclaim them and avenge the fallen.  \r\n\r\nHreidgar was among the first to pledge his blade to the barbarian shaman Jerrod when he united the tribes against Arakon, and he served tirelessly in the great battles ahead, even on the darkest day when Arakon unleashed armies of the hells against Jerrod and the tribes.  In every battle, Hreidgar and his greatsword were as one, howling like the wind as he drove his enemies back... and to their deaths.  But when Arakon was at last defeated, no trace of Hreidgar's wife and child were to be found. \r\n\r\nHreidgar continued his search, and his journey of many years is said to have taken him across the great cliffs of the Reghed Glacier during the Season of Raining Spears, upon the Sea of Moving Ice where he sailed with the Tribe of the Great Whale and fought slavers from the south, and then to his final destination, the small town of Enholm's Point, where he stood with the handful of the town's defenders against the army of Kresselack the Black Wolf.  It is said Hreidgar fought so fiercely that Kresselack conceded the field in honor of the warrior - but not before striking the fatal blow that would end the warrior's life.\r\n\r\nBleeding from numerous wounds, Hreidgar is said to have wandered north from Enholm's Point, traveling for many miles before collapsing to his knees.  With the last of his strength, the old warrior plunged his blade into the ice and said he had finally found what he had been seeking.  \"Let the sky wander,\" he proclaimed, \"for my travels are done.\"  \r\n\r\nWhen the townsfolk of Enholm's Point returned the next day to carry his body away, they found Hreidgar, but his blade had vanished.  It is said that the blade now wanders as the sky wanders, finding its way to others with long journeys before them... and guiding them to their final destination, whatever it may be.  \r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nDamage: 2d6 + 1\r\nAttack Bonus:  +1 \r\nEnchantment:  +1\r\nDamage Type:  Slashing\r\nSpecial: \r\n  Spell Power: Can cast Doom once\r\nWeight:  12 lb.\r\nFeat Requirement:  Martial Weapon, Great Sword\r\nType:  Two-handed",

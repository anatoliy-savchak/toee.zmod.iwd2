    "Text": "This journal, bound in exotic, jewel-encrusted leather and written with fine ink on parchment made from spider silk, reads as follows:\r\n\r\nWhere to begin...?  It hath been a tough life, to be sure - even from birth.  Being part of conjoined triplets, separated at the brink of death, has its boons and banes - as does any aspect of life I suppose.  I can hear my sisters' thoughts and feel their pain, but never have I known what it means to be alone - truly alone...\r\n\r\nLuskan was a gruff town - unforgiving, even if viewed in its best light.  'Tis certainly no place for three innocent, little women, but the bond we shared kept us together and alive.  Our parents were never around - always chasing the latest job offer or most-favorable rumor just to make ends meet.  With ruffians, bandits, and creatures of the night lurking in every shadowy corner, there were no individuals we could respect... except one - Lysan...\r\n\r\nLysan, a priestess of Auril and fellow Luskanite, shone like a celestial beacon across a sea of eternal darkness, and became our idol and inspiration with little effort.  Her goodwill and fortitude we adored - her adventurousness we admired.  What greatness the four of us would hath achieved - how noble our exploits would hath been in spreading our seeds of compassion throughout the winter land, only to watch them blossom into flowers of love come spring!  The goal was as clear as a crystal trapped within a drop of ice, until...\r\n\r\nWhere was I when the news pierced our hearts like a javelin hurled from the Nine Hells Itself...?  Lysan... poor, sweet Lysan was slaughtered, like a diseased goblin, in Kresselack's Tomb by a band of villains in heroes' clothing.  Why?!  Because of her beliefs?!  Thirty years hath passed, yet the pain lingers.  At that moment a new goal emerged - her path was now ours, and we immediately joined the church of Auril in town...\r\n\r\nOur ambition quickly dwarfed that small temple, so we headed east to join Auril's Breath in Glister.  Ironically that congregation proved too large for us, so we headed north to establish a church of our own, as well as retrace the steps of our martyr, Lysan.  Reinforcing our decision to travel north, we had also heard that the mysterious demon twins we knew of in Luskan were also in that area, so we undoubtedly had to see if those rumors were true...\r\n\r\nEn route we stumbled upon an envoy from the Legion of the Chimera and were eventually led to Madae.  Despite our humanity, the four of us became instant, though reserved, friends, and 'twas soon obvious that her wants, needs, and desires complimented our own...\r\n\r\nThe deal was simple - if we guarded the Western Pass against reinforcements to the Ten-Towns, they would destroy Kuldahar and give us its precious Heartstone Gem.  The pieces of our plan were falling into place - all we needed was the right time to seal them together...\r\n\r\nThat time came during our Coming Storm festival when my sisters and I led our newly formed congregation of one hundred strong in a prayer so profound, Auril Herself blessed us with Her embrace.  The glacier was thus born.  All that remained was the temple's creation - *our* temple - which Nickademus, arch-architect, honored guest and former lover of Oria accomplished with impressive speed and skill...\r\n\r\nWhat an oddity - this temple of his.  Even *I* get lost from time to time.  The dais is an interesting concept, but why must I turn it left north, then right all the way around again just to unleash the abishai to do my bidding?  Still, no effort is too great in pleasing Great Auril by sacrificing prisoners to her to keep the glacier from melting...\r\n\r\nTime is short, so the painting - though it seems to possess a mind of its own - is useful when I must quickly cleanse myself before speaking to the Frostmaiden...\r\n\r\nThe prism is a dangerous device, but what Lady Sherincal wants she gets - still, it keeps prying eyes away from Mother Winter and our treasury, so perchance I judge it too harshly...\r\n\r\nOria's Game Room is a waste of time to me - I hath no time for meaningless combat and see no reason to enter the ethereal realm while confined to its limited boundary.  And *why* Nickademus would install a Mirror of Life Trapping eludes all logic and common sense...!\r\n\r\nNickademus... I wish I could trust him - he does not walk our path.  For his sake, I hope he does not betray us again...\r\n\r\nWeight:  5 lb.",

    "Text": "Kellem Longeyes was a noted ranger in the town of Bremen, trekking far and wide across the Savage North in pursuit of his prey.  Kellem hunted wyverns, drakes, and other wyrms of all sorts, especially those that made to attack the Ten-Towns or their outlying settlements.  The grizzled ranger took many trophies - in time, little of his equipment was not adorned with one kind of wyrm or another.\r\n\r\nKellem's most prized trophy, though, was from Frostmaw, a great white wyrm whose size and ferocity matched that of a true dragon's.  While in its death-throes, Frostmaw's jaws and icy breath took Kellem's left eye and ear - for this, the grim ranger swore vengeance on all its cursed ilk.  Upon his return to civilization, Kellem had Frostmaw's wide jaws fashioned into an elaborate helm and imbued with the white wyrm's deadly breath.  This helm the ranger christened \"Wyrm's Maw.\"\r\n\r\nAlas, in time Kellem grew old as all men do, and one day set out on a dangerous hunt in the peaks of the Spine of the World never to return.  Until now, none of his equipment has ever been found.\r\n\r\nKellem's helm is made from thick hide, bone, and heavy gray-white scales.  It covers the face and head entirely.  Aside from cutting a dashing figure, the helm's bearer may bellow out a roaring blast of deadly cold once per day.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nArmor Bonus:  None\r\nSpecial:\r\n  White Wyrm's Breath: breathe a cone of frost for 6-24 point of cold damage 1/day\r\nWeight: 3 lb.",

      "Text": "Kellem Longeyes was a noted ranger in the town of Bremen, trekking far and wide across the Savage North in pursuit of his prey.  Kellem hunted wyverns, drakes, and other wyrms of all sorts, especially those that made to attack the Ten-Towns or their outlying settlements.  The grizzled ranger took many trophies - in time, little of his equipment was not adorned with one kind of wyrm or another.\r\n\r\nKellem's most prized trophy, though, was from Frostmaw, a great white wyrm whose size and ferocity matched that of a true dragon's.  While in its death-throes, Frostmaw's jaws and icy breath took Kellem's left eye and ear - for this, the grim ranger swore vengeance on all its cursed ilk.  Upon his return to civilization, Kellem had Frostmaw's wide jaws fashioned into an elaborate helm and imbued with the white wyrm's deadly breath.  This helm the ranger christened \"Wyrm's Maw.\"\r\n\r\nAlas, in time Kellem grew old as all men do, and one day set out on a dangerous hunt in the peaks of the Spine of the World never to return.  Until now, none of his equipment has ever been found.\r\n\r\nKellem's helm is made from thick hide, bone, and heavy gray-white scales.  It covers the face and head entirely.  Aside from cutting a dashing figure, the helm's bearer may bellow out a roaring blast of deadly cold once per day.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nArmor Bonus:  None\r\nSpecial:\r\n  White Wyrm's Breath: breathe a cone of frost for 6-24 point of cold damage 1/day\r\nWeight: 3 lb.",

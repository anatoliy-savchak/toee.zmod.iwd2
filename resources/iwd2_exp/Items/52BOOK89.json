    "Text": "This tome details the history of Valas Belaem Del Pharm, the Black Raven, and that of the Black Raven Monastery.\r\n\r\nThe monastery was built in the year 1181, founded by a half-human, half-drow slave who escaped his cruel masters in the underdark, fighting his way to the surface world and freedom with nothing more than his bare hands and the very chains that once bound them.\r\n\r\nThe half-drow's name was Valas Belaem Del Pharm - Valas, Slave of Pharm.  As a child Valas was a house-servant of the Leun, but soon grew into a lean and powerful young adult.  While most families are reluctant to keep such dangerous slaves, Valas was lost in a wager to an opposing family - the Pharm - who kept him alive simply to spite the Leun.  Valas became the greatest champion of the Pharm's gladiator stable - in fact, the greatest of all of the Rilauven stables - before he escaped.  It was then, during the decades spent in the dark city's majestically spired arena of blood sports, that Valas developed his legendary fighting skills.\r\n\r\nThe book goes on to recount in detail how Valas escapes, surfacing in the Spine of the World at the headwaters of the Black Raven River.  The first men he comes across are the Uthgardt barbarians of the Black Raven Tribe at Raven Rock.  The barbarians don't know what to make of Valas, who shows up out of nowhere with crimson eyes, jet-black skin and hair to match, half-naked and with bloody chains dangling from his wrists.  Naturally, their bravest attack... and are promptly defeated.  The barbarians think him a spirit warrior sent to punish their arrogance and christen him the Black Raven, a name that Valas takes as his own.  They're later saddened but slightly relieved to see him leave.  Valas travels the world as the Black Raven, fights against slavery and imprisonment wherever it's found (making a great deal of enemies in the process), collects a throng of loyal students, teaches them his ideals and martial techniques, and eventually returns with them to the Spine of the World to build the Black Raven Monastery.  He eventually dies quietly of old age, is interred beneath the monastery in a tomb near the underground headwaters of the Black Raven River, and with that his story ends.\r\n\r\nWeight:  2 lb.",

All that remained of him was his elaborate parrying blade, left spinning on the deck as if he'd never been there.\r\n\r\nSulo elected to graft the swordsman's parrying blade to the stump of his left wrist in the place of a common hook.  When Sulo was killed some nine years later, the blade was interned with him in a concealed tomb along with a substantial quantity of gems and coins.  Despite the \"secret\" nature of Sulo's final resting place, the site was quickly plundered and Sulo's Hook passed into hands of other men.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nDamage:  1d4 \r\nAttack Bonus: -2 penalty\r\nDamage Type:  Piercing\r\nSpecial: \r\n Deflection Bonus: +3 \r\nWeight: 1 lb.\r\nFeat Requirement:  Simple Weapon, Small Blade\r\nType:  One-handed",

    "Text": "Mensel of Cormyr, at one time the Lord of Immersea, was that rare sort of nobleman, a fellow well known to be kind, generous, and humanitarian to a fault.  He was much loved by his family, servants, and those that lived upon his lands.  Well after the elderly Lord Mensel had passed away in his sleep, a secret vault was found hidden beneath his study.  Within the vault Mensel's heirs found a small hoard of treasure... and the Vile Grimoire Pervertere.\r\n\r\nThough the origins of the grimoire and the identity of anyone associated with it - save the late Lord Mensel, of course - are still unknown, unwholesome rumors sprang up like mushrooms and still abound after nearly a century.  The worst of the scandalous claims involved a seer from Arabel, a pious young man that seemed saddened to explain that Lord Mensel had the grimoire fashioned for himself at great expense and then slew all those involved in its making - an assertion that did no less than bring ruin to Mensel's name and family.\r\n\r\nThe unsavory book was cast into a temple brazier but, to the astonishment of numerous witnesses, it vanished in a cloud of foul-smelling vapor rather than bursting into flames.  Since that day the Obscene Grimoire has appeared in many places, never found intentionally and always disappearing again within a few year's time.\r\n\r\nThe thick, black, leather-bound book is filled with painstakingly detailed woodblock prints, each depicting a gruesome scene of violent perversion.  Even the briefest of glances through its disturbing pages is enough to assure the reader that no taboo is left unturned.  However, for those willing to carefully peruse the disquieting work, there are dark runes and ritual directions hidden among the illumination around each print.  Those so inclined are able to use the power of Mensel's Obscene Grimoire to summon a cacofiend, bound to the reader's service, once per day.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nSpecial:\r\n  Using the grimoire casts both Protection From Evil and Cacofiend.\r\n  The Mensel's Vile Grimoire Pervertere vanishes when one attempts to destroy it.\r\nWeight: 2 lb.",

      "Text": "Mensel of Cormyr, at one time the Lord of Immersea, was that rare sort of nobleman, a fellow well known to be kind, generous, and humanitarian to a fault.  He was much loved by his family, servants, and those that lived upon his lands.  Well after the elderly Lord Mensel had passed away in his sleep, a secret vault was found hidden beneath his study.  Within the vault Mensel's heirs found a small hoard of treasure... and the Vile Grimoire Pervertere.\r\n\r\nThough the origins of the grimoire and the identity of anyone associated with it - save the late Lord Mensel, of course - are still unknown, unwholesome rumors sprang up like mushrooms and still abound after nearly a century.  The worst of the scandalous claims involved a seer from Arabel, a pious young man that seemed saddened to explain that Lord Mensel had the grimoire fashioned for himself at great expense and then slew all those involved in its making - an assertion that did no less than bring ruin to Mensel's name and family.\r\n\r\nThe unsavory book was cast into a temple brazier but, to the astonishment of numerous witnesses, it vanished in a cloud of foul-smelling vapor rather than bursting into flames.  Since that day the Obscene Grimoire has appeared in many places, never found intentionally and always disappearing again within a few year's time.\r\n\r\nThe thick, black, leather-bound book is filled with painstakingly detailed woodblock prints, each depicting a gruesome scene of violent perversion.  Even the briefest of glances through its disturbing pages is enough to assure the reader that no taboo is left unturned.  However, for those willing to carefully peruse the disquieting work, there are dark runes and ritual directions hidden among the illumination around each print.  Those so inclined are able to use the power of Mensel's Obscene Grimoire to summon a cacofiend, bound to the reader's service, once per day.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nSpecial:\r\n  Using the grimoire casts both Protection From Evil and Cacofiend.\r\n  The Mensel's Vile Grimoire Pervertere vanishes when one attempts to destroy it.\r\nWeight: 2 lb.",

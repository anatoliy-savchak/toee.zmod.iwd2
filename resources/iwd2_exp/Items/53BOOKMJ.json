The drow had intended to assault the citadel's guards, prompting them to open the gates to summon more thralls and thus expose the citadel interior.  However, with the arrival of so many driders in the area, the gate guards withdrew into the citadel and have yet to return.\r\n\r\nMalavon is certain that if the number of driders can be reduced, the citadel guards will return to their position at Z'hinda's gates.

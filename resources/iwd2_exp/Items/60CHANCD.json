    "Text": "Drakkas Ranul was an outcast Moon Elf with a huge chip on his shoulder.  At a very young age, Drakkas was kidnapped by a Drow raiding party and brought up by the Drow to be a pit fighter.  At first he fought his fellow kidnap victims in the pits.  However, over time, his fellow abductees died from their wounds and poor treatment, thus leaving Drakkas alone to eventually fight monsters of the Drow's choosing.  Drakkas persevered, fueled by his ever-growing hatred for his captors, the hopes of one day escaping and then taking revenge on his kidnappers.\r\n\r\nOne day Drakkas got his wish - he was able to escape by stealing his jail cell keys from his lazy night guard, and then stealthfully slipping out into the unforgiving Underdark.  He managed to steal a couple of scimitars on his way out, which he put to good use while circumventing the twisted corridors of the Underdark.  When he emerged on the surface, he immediately sought out his Moon Elf kin. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, when he found his kin, they ostracized him due to his horrendous battle scars.  Embittered and outcast, he made it his mission in life to exact the most painful revenge possible on his kidnappers.  Drakkas diligently trained in the dark magics, and continued his formidable weapons training as well.  When he got to the point where he felt he was ready, he began to sell his services as a mercenary to earn coin and buy better equipment.  One thing in particular he eventually wanted was lightweight chain mail that would not interfere with his spell casting.  Luck was with him the day he found a Dwarven armorsmith who could accommodate Drakkas' needs.  It was not long after until the armor was finished and Drakkas was ready for his mission of revenge.  \r\n\r\nDrakkas disappeared from the people who knew him and utilized his mercenary services, and ventured into the depths of the Underdark, where he was never heard from again.  However, his special armor did somehow make it out of the Underdark.  No one knows how, but speculation has it that the return of Drakkas' chain mail to the surface world was a subtle message from the Drow.  The message, of course, was left to the imagination of the interpreter. \r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nNo Armor Proficiency Required\r\nArmor Bonus: +7\r\nMax Dex Bonus:  None\r\nArmor Check Penalty:  -0\r\nArcane Spell Failure:  0%\r\nSpecial:\r\n Spellcasting and Thieving abilities can be performed without penalties from wearing armor.\r\nWeight: 30 lb.",

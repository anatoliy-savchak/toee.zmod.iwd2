    "Text": "Hiepherus Note: \r\n\r\nThis scrap of parchment, burned around the edges and smelling faintly of bloodweed incense, seems to be a daily log of some sort:\r\n\r\n- - - \r\n\r\nThe visions began when I pledged Bane's strength to Isair and Madae, and I now know Bane has placed a test before me - to test my devotion to his cause against my service to the Legion of the Chimera.  Could it be he thinks I hold Isair and Madae's words with more weight than his doctrines...? I MUST prove him wrong.  The visions show an ancient blade that has slain six... six companions of vile hearts who were once in Bane's service in the distant past.  The six were known as the Lost Followers, and from what I can see in my visions, they now lie in screaming prisons upon the Ethereal Plane.  If they are to be set free, the blade MUST be recovered and destroyed... if I cannot find it, then I fear I shall join them in their undead prisons. \r\n\r\n- - - \r\n\r\nI have come to the glen shown to me in the visions, but the accursed blade that murdered the Lost Followers eludes me! Something within Kuldahar is preventing my scrying efforts, and without the visions to guide me, I cannot hope to recover the consecration medallion and tear the blade from the graves within the Glen... whichever damned one it is! Give me something to KILL as my challenge, not this endless hunting and searching, and I will prove that I serve Bane's will!\r\n\r\n- - - \r\n\r\nIn a fit of rage, I have raised many dead in the Glen to do my will and used my powers to tear answers from them, but of the blade and the medallion's fate, the dead know *nothing*... but speak much of the serpents that have passed through the valley of late.  Could it be that somehow Cedra or one of her half-breed minions secured the medallion and even now hold it in one of their chambers, unaware of its true purpose?!  If so, I may need to wrest it from them by force... which would break my allegiance to the Chimera and destroy everything that we have worked for.  Is it Bane's will that the Chimera's spine be broken? But the potential of their strength... allied with Bane, of course... would bring the North and the lands beyond to its knees! The elves, dwarves, humans, all crushed, burned, their ashes scattered to the winds! But, I must be mindful - the will of the Black Lord is not for me to question... or to know. \r\n\r\n- - - \r\n\r\nIt has been many days, and I have sent the dead into the Valley to slay whatever humans they can find.  Yet... with every day that passes in the Glen, I can feel the presence of the Lost Followers, clawing at the material plane, waiting to be freed.  I fear that simply finding the blade will bring them howling to this place... and they may be beyond all reason when they are summoned.  If so, then I had best have Bane's protections about me, or else the Six will level Kuldahar and the lands around in revenge for dying at the blade's hands.  I may be forced to destroy them against my Lord's will.  Could that be my challenge? Whatever the reason, I MUST find the blade, and find it soon, before its powers are unearthed by one who stands against the Legion of the Chimera... and Bane... and if the blade should find its way into the hands of a holy warrior, then ALL is lost.\r\n\r\nBlood in the Black Lord's name,\r\n\r\nHiepherus, D- *\r\n\r\n*You notice that where the title \"Dreadmaster of Bane\" would be next to Hiepherus' name, the parchment has been blackened to ash, as if it was held over a candle... or exposed to the far-seeing eye of Bane's disfavor.\r\n\r\nWeight:  0 lb.",

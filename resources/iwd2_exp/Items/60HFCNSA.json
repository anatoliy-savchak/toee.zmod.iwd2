    "Text": "Maya Selvinis was a solitary half-elf ranger who lived on the outskirts of Neverwinter.  Feeling different and un-whole due to her breeding, she rarely had any interaction with other people except when she was summoned to aid in a crisis.  Although she did not care for the company of others, she was more than eager to aid those in peril.  However, after helping others, she would quickly return to her solitary ways, despite the general tolerance exhibited by the locals in Neverwinter.\r\n\r\nOne special event that called for her ranger skills came and changed her life forever.  An elderly female cleric of Eilistraee came to Maya and asked her aid in tracking down and destroying a demon that was tormenting her flock.  Maya eagerly accepted the quest, put on her splint mail armor, secured her sword, and followed the cleric through the woods.  After a day's travel, the cleric stopped at a small clearing between four towering trees.  In the middle of the clearing was a small pond of water no wider than a yard.  The cleric turned to Maya and said that the demon could be seen in the pond.  Doubting, Maya approached the pond and peered in.  The only thing Maya saw was her own reflection, and she stated that fact rather tersely to the cleric.  The cleric smirked a bit and replied by saying that the demon was her reflection.  In fact, the cleric pointed out that the demon was responsible for Maya's solitude and self-pity, and that the only one who was concerned about Maya's mixed breeding was Maya.\r\n\r\nMaya scoffed at the cleric, told her that she did not know what she was talking about, turned and started to head back in the direction they came.  The cleric shouted back, which startled Maya, and declared that she understood more than Maya could ever know.  It was at that point that the elderly cleric revealed herself to be Maya's mother.  Maya again scoffed, stating that her mother died long ago.  The cleric bowed her head and replied that yes, she did die, but that she was granted the grace of Eilistaee to seek out Maya and aid her - aid her in destroying the demon of self-pity and solitude.  The cleric then went on to say that Maya would never find sanctuary by alienating herself from the company of others, but that sanctuary comes from within.  Once Maya could accept who she was, what she was, and the fact that there were many out in the world like her and who were willing to embrace her, then sanctuary would follow her, always.  Then, in a brief flash of light, the cleric was gone, leaving Maya to stew with the wisdom of the old cleric - her mother.\r\n\r\nMaya thought on what her mother said, and soon tried to implement her mother's wisdom.  After a few months, Maya found her inner sanctuary, and became more powerful because of it.  In fact, that power was also absorbed by her splint mail armor.  All those who donned Maya's splint mail felt a peace flow through their being.  Each person found their own personal sanctuary within that armor, which soon became known as Sanctity of Being.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nHeavy Armor\r\nArmor Bonus: +8\r\nMax Dex Bonus:  +0\r\nArmor Check Penalty:  -6\r\nArcane Spell Failure:  40%\r\nSpecial:\r\n  Spell Power:  Can cast the spell Sanctuary twice per day. \r\n  Spellward:  Immunity to Cloak of Fear, Horror and Charm Person spells\r\nWeight: 40 lb.",

      "Text": "Maya Selvinis was a solitary half-elf ranger who lived on the outskirts of Neverwinter.  Feeling different and un-whole due to her breeding, she rarely had any interaction with other people except when she was summoned to aid in a crisis.  Although she did not care for the company of others, she was more than eager to aid those in peril.  However, after helping others, she would quickly return to her solitary ways, despite the general tolerance exhibited by the locals in Neverwinter.\r\n\r\nOne special event that called for her ranger skills came and changed her life forever.  An elderly female cleric of Eilistraee came to Maya and asked her aid in tracking down and destroying a demon that was tormenting her flock.  Maya eagerly accepted the quest, put on her splint mail armor, secured her sword, and followed the cleric through the woods.  After a day's travel, the cleric stopped at a small clearing between four towering trees.  In the middle of the clearing was a small pond of water no wider than a yard.  The cleric turned to Maya and said that the demon could be seen in the pond.  Doubting, Maya approached the pond and peered in.  The only thing Maya saw was her own reflection, and she stated that fact rather tersely to the cleric.  The cleric smirked a bit and replied by saying that the demon was her reflection.  In fact, the cleric pointed out that the demon was responsible for Maya's solitude and self-pity, and that the only one who was concerned about Maya's mixed breeding was Maya.\r\n\r\nMaya scoffed at the cleric, told her that she did not know what she was talking about, turned and started to head back in the direction they came.  The cleric shouted back, which startled Maya, and declared that she understood more than Maya could ever know.  It was at that point that the elderly cleric revealed herself to be Maya's mother.  Maya again scoffed, stating that her mother died long ago.  The cleric bowed her head and replied that yes, she did die, but that she was granted the grace of Eilistaee to seek out Maya and aid her - aid her in destroying the demon of self-pity and solitude.  The cleric then went on to say that Maya would never find sanctuary by alienating herself from the company of others, but that sanctuary comes from within.  Once Maya could accept who she was, what she was, and the fact that there were many out in the world like her and who were willing to embrace her, then sanctuary would follow her, always.  Then, in a brief flash of light, the cleric was gone, leaving Maya to stew with the wisdom of the old cleric - her mother.\r\n\r\nMaya thought on what her mother said, and soon tried to implement her mother's wisdom.  After a few months, Maya found her inner sanctuary, and became more powerful because of it.  In fact, that power was also absorbed by her splint mail armor.  All those who donned Maya's splint mail felt a peace flow through their being.  Each person found their own personal sanctuary within that armor, which soon became known as Sanctity of Being.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nHeavy Armor\r\nArmor Bonus: +8\r\nMax Dex Bonus:  +0\r\nArmor Check Penalty:  -6\r\nArcane Spell Failure:  40%\r\nSpecial:\r\n  Spell Power:  Can cast the spell Sanctuary twice per day. \r\n  Spellward:  Immunity to Cloak of Fear, Horror and Charm Person spells\r\nWeight: 40 lb.",

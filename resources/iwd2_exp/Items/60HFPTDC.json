In fact, most bludgeoning weapons were created with the intention of blowing through full plate armor. \r\n\r\nWith this thought in mind, the armor known as Diamond Cutter was forged.  No one is exactly sure how Diamond Cutter came into existence, but what is known is that the renowned Mirabar armorsmith, Cutter Boomstock, one day unveiled the armor to a well-to-do knight who traveled all the way from Amn.  Diamond Cutter glistened in the firelight like a thousand diamonds, almost blinding was the intensity of the sheen.  And, in a remarkable demonstration, Cutter Boomstock lifted his anvil high in the air and struck the armor.  To everyone's amazement, the strike left no mark on the sparkling armor.   \r\n\r\nThe knight happily took the armor and left Mirabar forever, never to be seen again.  However, his armor, Diamond Cutter, has been seen from time to time, leading people to speculate that the elaborate knight met an untimely death.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nHeavy Armor\r\nArmor Bonus: +10\r\nMax Dex Bonus:  +1\r\nArmor Check Penalty:  -5\r\nArcane Spell Failure:  35%\r\nSpecial:\r\n  Resistance: 1/- resistance to bludgeoning/slashing/piercing damage. \r\n  Constitution: +2\r\nWeight: 50 lb.",

In fact, most bludgeoning weapons were created with the intention of blowing through full plate armor. \r\n\r\nWith this thought in mind, the armor known as Diamond Cutter was forged.  No one is exactly sure how Diamond Cutter came into existence, but what is known is that the renowned Mirabar armorsmith, Cutter Boomstock, one day unveiled the armor to a well-to-do knight who traveled all the way from Amn.  Diamond Cutter glistened in the firelight like a thousand diamonds, almost blinding was the intensity of the sheen.  And, in a remarkable demonstration, Cutter Boomstock lifted his anvil high in the air and struck the armor.  To everyone's amazement, the strike left no mark on the sparkling armor.   \r\n\r\nThe knight happily took the armor and left Mirabar forever, never to be seen again.  However, his armor, Diamond Cutter, has been seen from time to time, leading people to speculate that the elaborate knight met an untimely death.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nHeavy Armor\r\nArmor Bonus: +10\r\nMax Dex Bonus:  +1\r\nArmor Check Penalty:  -5\r\nArcane Spell Failure:  35%\r\nSpecial:\r\n  Resistance: 1/- resistance to bludgeoning/slashing/piercing damage. \r\n  Constitution: +2\r\nWeight: 50 lb.",

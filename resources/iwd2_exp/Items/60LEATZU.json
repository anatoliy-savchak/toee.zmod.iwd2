Unfortunately, one of the side effects of Mizelle's new armor was a zombie curse that made her very socially unappealing.  However, she was so desperate to destroy the necromancer, she did not care.  With the ability to resist the necromancer's death spells, she cut him down with the ferocity of a demon.  Soon afterwards, she went to a cleric of Sune and had the cursed armor removed, never to be used again by the wild elf ranger.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nLight Armor\r\nArmor Bonus: +6\r\nMax Dex Bonus:  +5\r\nArmor Check Penalty:  -0\r\nArcane Spell Failure:  15%\r\nSpecial:\r\n  Cursed: Once donned, this armor cannot be removed without a Remove Curse spell\r\n  Charisma: -2\r\n  Wearer under the effects of the spell Death Ward\r\nWeight: 20 lb.",

While leather armor is a hardened shell, studded leather armor is soft and supple with hundreds of metal rivets affixed.  The rivets are so close together that they form a flexible coating of hard metal that turns aside slashing and cutting attacks.  The soft leather backing is little more than a means of securing the rivets in place.  ",

Unfortunately, one of the side effects of Mizelle's new armor was a zombie curse that made her very socially unappealing.  However, she was so desperate to destroy the necromancer, she did not care.  With the ability to resist the necromancer's death spells, she cut him down with the ferocity of a demon.  Soon afterwards, she went to a cleric of Sune and had the cursed armor removed, never to be used again by the wild elf ranger.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nLight Armor\r\nArmor Bonus: +6\r\nMax Dex Bonus:  +5\r\nArmor Check Penalty:  -0\r\nArcane Spell Failure:  15%\r\nSpecial:\r\n  Cursed: Once donned, this armor cannot be removed without a Remove Curse spell\r\n  Charisma: -2\r\n  Wearer under the effects of the spell Death Ward\r\nWeight: 20 lb.",

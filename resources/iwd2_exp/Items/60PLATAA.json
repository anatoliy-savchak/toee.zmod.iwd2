    "Text": "Aasimars are direct offspring from a union between mortal and celestial minion.  While normally carrying innate powers, it is not unusual for an Aasimar to don blessed armor.  Such is the case for this unique armor known as Aasimar's Aura.  The armor shimmers with a silvery glow and is adorned with exquisite blue etchings across the breast.  One look at the armor and it is simple to see that it possesses powerful protections.\r\n\r\nLong ago, the Blood War between the Baazetu and the Tanar'ri spilled over to the material plane.  Luckily for most of the world, the battle was far away from any major towns or cities.  However, this was still no comfort for the Celestial beings that watched over the material plane.  So, it was quickly decided to amass as many Celestial and Aasimar beings as possible and drive the Blood War back into its own abyssal planes.  However, because of the great numbers of Tanar'ri and Baazetu, the Celestial beings permanently blessed all the Aasimars' armor with Protection from Evil.  This spell allowed the Aasimars to get in close to the evil creatures without getting attacked.  Once all the Aasimars were in position, the Celestials gave the order to attack, which completely surprised the hordes of Baazetu and Tanar'ri.  The ensuing battle raged for days, with high casualties on both sides, but eventually the evil hordes were pushed back into their abyssal planes. \r\n\r\nAs a result of the high Aasimar casualties, it was not uncommon for looters to take the armor off the dead.  So, from time to time, a set of Aasimar's Aura will pop up in a shop, or on an adventurer who could afford the high purchase price.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nHeavy Armor\r\nArmor Bonus: +10\r\nMax Dex Bonus:  +1\r\nArmor Check Penalty:  -5\r\nArcane Spell Failure:  35%\r\nSpecial:\r\n  Wearer is under the effect of the spell Protection from Evil\r\nWeight: 50 lb.",

      "Text": "Aasimars are direct offspring from a union between mortal and celestial minion.  While normally carrying innate powers, it is not unusual for an Aasimar to don blessed armor.  Such is the case for this unique armor known as Aasimar's Aura.  The armor shimmers with a silvery glow and is adorned with exquisite blue etchings across the breast.  One look at the armor and it is simple to see that it possesses powerful protections.\r\n\r\nLong ago, the Blood War between the Baazetu and the Tanar'ri spilled over to the material plane.  Luckily for most of the world, the battle was far away from any major towns or cities.  However, this was still no comfort for the Celestial beings that watched over the material plane.  So, it was quickly decided to amass as many Celestial and Aasimar beings as possible and drive the Blood War back into its own abyssal planes.  However, because of the great numbers of Tanar'ri and Baazetu, the Celestial beings permanently blessed all the Aasimars' armor with Protection from Evil.  This spell allowed the Aasimars to get in close to the evil creatures without getting attacked.  Once all the Aasimars were in position, the Celestials gave the order to attack, which completely surprised the hordes of Baazetu and Tanar'ri.  The ensuing battle raged for days, with high casualties on both sides, but eventually the evil hordes were pushed back into their abyssal planes. \r\n\r\nAs a result of the high Aasimar casualties, it was not uncommon for looters to take the armor off the dead.  So, from time to time, a set of Aasimar's Aura will pop up in a shop, or on an adventurer who could afford the high purchase price.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nHeavy Armor\r\nArmor Bonus: +10\r\nMax Dex Bonus:  +1\r\nArmor Check Penalty:  -5\r\nArcane Spell Failure:  35%\r\nSpecial:\r\n  Wearer is under the effect of the spell Protection from Evil\r\nWeight: 50 lb.",

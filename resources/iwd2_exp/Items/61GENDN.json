    "Text": "This long scroll of parchment contains the alchemical notes of D'hey-jazerrion.  The notes are quite extensive, but there are four items of interest: \r\n\r\n- D'hey-jazerrion seems to have had some recent trouble restoring the lever in the southern section of the ziggurat chamber, which is vital to all the alchemical operations below.  There is some indication that he intends to return soon to fix it, and it looks like he is the only one who can.  There haven't been any notes made in the past few days, so he may be due back soon... it looks like all one can do is wait for him to return to fix the lever. \r\n\r\n- D'hey-jazerrion has numerous notes on the creation of \"wyvern poison,\" and the process appears simple enough for even an unskilled alchemist to perform.  Take a wyvern's stinger, lay it upon the westernmost bench in the lab, then proceed to the lever (mentioned above) south of the ziggurat in the chamber north of the lab.  From there, simply pulling the lever will cause the stinger's venom to be distilled into the various beakers in the lab.  After half a minute, the procedure will finish and the alchemist can unlock the distiller with the lever - if the lever is not unlocked, green lights (signifying the distillation procedure is still active) will flash around the tables, and the labs cannot be accessed.  When the process is complete, every stinger placed upon the bench should be distilled into a bottle of wyvern poison.  D'hey-jazerrion appears to perform this process frequently... but there is no mention of why he does this. \r\n\r\n- The notes also contain a great deal of D'hey-jazerrion's schedule.  Apparently, he is not always within the lab, and he prefers to let some of his mixtures sit for several days to ensure their purity, whether they need it or not. \r\n\r\n- Most interesting is the steps required to create the yuan-ti histachii, or \"brood guards.\"  The majority of the steps detail the creation of a histachii brew that transforms a humanoid into the creature.  With these notes, a skilled alchemist could perform the procedure in the lab where they were found.  The alchemist would have to execute the operation themselves to ensure the reagents are pure, but the procedure is quite simple.  Mandrake root must be placed on a prepared distilling table (which, according to the notes, seems to be the easternmost table in the center of the lab - it should already have a number of histachii potions on it).  Once that has been done, the alchemist must pull the lever (mentioned above) in the southern part of the ziggurat chamber that lies north of the lab to activate the distiller.  After half a minute, the procedure will finish and the alchemist can unlock the distiller with the lever.  The histachii brew can then be removed from the table.\r\n\r\nBecause only a portion of the mandrake is used, a single sample can create many fully potent brews.\r\n\r\nNOTE: While distilling the wyvern poison can be done with no training, only a character possessing these notes and above a 15 Alchemy skill can successfully distill the histachii brew; otherwise the player must enlist the services of someone skilled with the procedure to distill the brew... either by intimidating or tricking them.  It also looks like the lever in the ziggurat chamber to the north must wait for D'hey-jazzerion to return to fix it before any of the alchemical processes can take place. \r\n\r\nWeight:  0 lb.",

So was the case with Nasty Phil, the local corpse cleaner for the Ten Towns many years ago.  Nasty Phil, you see, was no undertaker - no, it was his responsibility, after a party of adventurers dispatched with a monster (or monsters) that was terrorizing a local community, to clean up the mess that was left over.  \r\n\r\nThe truly 'nasty' thing about Phil and the reason he got his nickname was that he relished his job.  He specially crafted this armor from the hides of different creatures so that he could delve even deeper into the more gruesome clean-up jobs.  In fact, it was not unusual for Nasty Phil to not clean himself after one of his jobs and prance around town covered in stinking, rotting flesh.  Bits and pieces of unidentified particles could be seen dangling off Nasty Phil's leather, prompting the locals to name his leather armor, Dirty Bits.\r\n\r\nOver time, his leather armor developed immunities to certain things just from absorbing the years of monster mess that was never washed off.  Even though Dirty Bits has been cleaned from time to time, it still has bits of unidentified 'stuff' that seem to have fused itself to the armor, helping it to retain its dirty name.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nLight Armor\r\nArmor Bonus: +4\r\nMax Dex Bonus:  +6\r\nArmor Check Penalty:  -0\r\nArcane Spell Failure:  15%\r\nSpecial:\r\n  Saving Throw Bonus: +2 to Fortitude saves\r\n  Resistance: 1/- Acid Resistance\r\nWeight: 25 lb.",

      "Text": "It is often said that a person does not choose a profession, the profession chooses the person.  So was the case with Nasty Phil, the local corpse cleaner for the Ten Towns many years ago.  Nasty Phil, you see, was no undertaker - no, it was his responsibility, after a party of adventurers dispatched with a monster (or monsters) that was terrorizing a local community, to clean up the mess that was left over.  \r\n\r\nThe truly 'nasty' thing about Phil and the reason he got his nickname was that he relished his job.  He specially crafted this armor from the hides of different creatures so that he could delve even deeper into the more gruesome clean-up jobs.  In fact, it was not unusual for Nasty Phil to not clean himself after one of his jobs and prance around town covered in stinking, rotting flesh.  Bits and pieces of unidentified particles could be seen dangling off Nasty Phil's leather, prompting the locals to name his leather armor, Dirty Bits.\r\n\r\nOver time, his leather armor developed immunities to certain things just from absorbing the years of monster mess that was never washed off.  Even though Dirty Bits has been cleaned from time to time, it still has bits of unidentified 'stuff' that seem to have fused itself to the armor, helping it to retain its dirty name.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nLight Armor\r\nArmor Bonus: +4\r\nMax Dex Bonus:  +6\r\nArmor Check Penalty:  -0\r\nArcane Spell Failure:  15%\r\nSpecial:\r\n  Saving Throw Bonus: +2 to Fortitude saves\r\n  Resistance: 1/- Acid Resistance\r\nWeight: 25 lb.",

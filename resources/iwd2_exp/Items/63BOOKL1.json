They sought to expand their sphere of influence and they also saw it as an opportunity to place a watchful eye on anything occurring in the frost-covered lands to the North.\r\n\r\nThe archmage Larrel was placed in charge of this task.  With a strong army at his back and the resources of the surrounding elven kingdoms, Larrel set forth to the Spine of the World Mountains.  Many years were spent making a route to the Northlands and finding a suitable location, and he eventually established an elven fortification in a forest that the elves felt comfortable calling home.  Under his guidance, the outpost thrived and became the elven eye that they dreamt of creating.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that the dark horde made their presence known.  A force mostly composed of goblins but within their ranks, some orc and ogre tribes, made their way to the North in search of new lands to rape and pillage.  Inevitably, conflict broke out between both sides as they fought for control of the surrounding lands.\r\n\r\nFor months, constant battles erupted taking their toll on both sides but neither ever gaining a foothold.  As more time passed, the elves eventually found themselves waning.  Although the elven forces were superior in battle against the ill equipped and untrained horde, they found themselves hard pressed to keep their ranks filled and well supplied due to the long distance between themselves and the elven kingdoms to the south.

    "Text": "The elves found themselves under attack again immediately as the horde entered the forest.  The outpost, although designed as a very defendable fortification, began to break under the force of its reckless attackers.  Although the horde was taking heavy casualties, they were winning.  Piece by piece, they were taking apart the elves.  Their outer defenses were eventually breached, and soon after, the main line of defense crumbled.  When all seemed lost to the elves, a battle cry was heard in the distance.\r\n    \r\nThe dwarven force watched in the distance as the horde began to lay waste to this remote outpost.  As they watched, they knew the orcs were completely frenzied with their blood lusted attack to notice what lay waiting behind them.  The dwarves knew this was the time to strike.  With a battle cry that rang throughout the battlefield, the dwarves charged into battle.  The horde was completely caught off guard and the dwarves took full advantage of it.  The dwarves cut down the rear guard with ease and pressed the attack.  The horde's vanguard immediately ceased their attack on the elves to deal with the dwarven threat.  \r\n\r\nGiven their only chance of living through this battle, the elves marshaled their remaining forces and with renewed strength, began a counter attack.  With the battle turned, the horde was in no way prepared to fight against two fronts.  Every last member of the horde was viciously cut down and thus ended their presence in the Spine of the World Mountains.\r\n\r\nWeight:  1 lb.",

The elves were vehemently opposed to this as they felt the humans were not worthy of such valued creations.  Although they had embraced their neighboring dwarves as comrades, the elves were still isolationists at heart.  In the end, the dwarves grudgingly conceded to the elves on this matter.\r\n\r\nSmall skirmishes started again between the alliance and the darker races.  Still ill equipped and untrained as before, the alliance spent little time being concerned.  Their complacency derived from the alliance being well established in the region along with the devastating power of their artifacts.  Little did they know that the dark races were entrenching themselves within the recesses of the Spine of the World Mountains.\r\n\r\nWith new armaments in hand, the large reckless horde of the darker races soon became a deadly force to contend with.  Attacks on the alliance became fiercer and more violent.  Although the alliance still found themselves on the winning side of each battle, they began to take unacceptable losses.  Also more disturbing was the discovery that the horde had within their possession the very same weapons that both races created together.  \r\n\r\nBoth races of the alliance spent months trying to find a logical explanation to the horde's possession of their magical artifacts.  During this time, the attacks from the dark races became more frequent and fiercer, straining the old ties of the alliance.  Soon, this turned into distrust.  The elves began to insinuate that the dwarves broke their promise and sold weapons to the untrustworthy humans who then sold them for a larger profit to the horde.  The dwarves resented such accusations considering they had just as much to lose from the darker hordes gaining these weapons.  This distrust became uglier as old discriminations of the other race began to surface.  \r\n\r\nWeight:  1 lb.",

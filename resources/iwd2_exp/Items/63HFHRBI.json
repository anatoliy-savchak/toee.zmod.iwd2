It is made entirely of steel, with rondels protecting and strengthening the grip.  Rondels are small disks of metal, often shaped into decorative designs.  The shaft is about 18 inches long.",

Its exquisitely crafted mithral hammer is much larger than most warhammers, yet seems no heavier.  Like many weapons made with the unholy enchantments of Iyachtu Xvim, the metal of the hammer seems to absorb light into its unbearable blackness.\r\n\r\nOn the few occasions that the Tyrannar Brutai Mar has used his weapon on his foes, Brutai has felt increased strength and improved accuracy.  In addition, some of the crushing blows were accompanied by bursts of Xvimian acid - the same acid that flows throw the waters within Severed Hand.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nDamage:  1d8 + 5\r\nAttack Bonus:  +5 \r\nEnchantment:  +5\r\nDamage Type:  Bludgeoning\r\nSpecial:\r\n  Impact: Increases chance of scoring a critical hit\r\n  Corrosive Burst:  33% chance +2d6 acid damage and 10% chance of +2d10 extra acid damage\r\n  Strength: +5 bonus\r\nWeight: 7 lb.\r\nFeat Requirement:  Martial Weapon, Hammer\r\nType:  One-handed",

Maces and flails are two previous examples of this - the warhammer is another.  The horseman's warhammer is the descendent of the Lucerne hammer.  It is made entirely of steel, with rondels protecting and strengthening the grip.  Rondels are small disks of metal, often shaped into decorative designs.  The shaft is about 18 inches long.",

Its exquisitely crafted mithral hammer is much larger than most warhammers, yet seems no heavier.  Like many weapons made with the unholy enchantments of Iyachtu Xvim, the metal of the hammer seems to absorb light into its unbearable blackness.\r\n\r\nOn the few occasions that the Tyrannar Brutai Mar has used his weapon on his foes, Brutai has felt increased strength and improved accuracy.  In addition, some of the crushing blows were accompanied by bursts of Xvimian acid - the same acid that flows throw the waters within Severed Hand.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nDamage:  1d8 + 5\r\nAttack Bonus:  +5 \r\nEnchantment:  +5\r\nDamage Type:  Bludgeoning\r\nSpecial:\r\n  Impact: Increases chance of scoring a critical hit\r\n  Corrosive Burst:  33% chance +2d6 acid damage and 10% chance of +2d10 extra acid damage\r\n  Strength: +5 bonus\r\nWeight: 7 lb.\r\nFeat Requirement:  Martial Weapon, Hammer\r\nType:  One-handed",

    "Text": "This enchanted short sword has been carved from a single piece of shale, its surface smeared with venom drawn from the tongue of a desert serpent.  The venom never dries, giving the sword an unhealthy sheen.  \r\n\r\nThis short sword is an evil weapon, said to have caused many lingering deaths over the years.  Its name comes from its last known owner, an infamous buccaneer named Letto who preyed on ships traveling upon the Sea of Moving Ice.  It is said that he was caught by the Tribe of the Great Whale in the shadow of Hehnhold's Iceberg, where his ship was hacked apart by the barbarians' great axes and the crew set aflame with burning pitch.  When the battle was over, only driftwood remained.  One of the pieces of his ship's hull found its way south and the wood was used in the construction of one of the rooms in the upper story of the Weeping Widow Inn.  The short sword has been buried within the timber for almost thirty or more years, waiting for someone to find it again and use it in Letto's name.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nDamage:  1d6 + 1, +2 vs. Good Creatures\r\nAttack Bonus:  +1, +2 vs. Good Creatures\r\nEnchantment:  +1\r\nDamage Type:  slashing\r\nSpecial:  10% Chance of Poisoning Target, -1 Penalty to Fortitude save When Held\r\nWeight: 3 lb.\r\nFeat Requirement:  Simple Weapon, Small Blade\r\nType:  One-handed",

In the simplest of terms, a short sword can be considered a dagger with a blade so long that it can no longer be called a dagger.  The term short sword does not exist in sword classifications.  However, it has come to be used to describe a double-edged blade about two feet in length.  The sword tip is usually pointed, ideal for thrusting.  ",

      "Text": "This enchanted short sword has been carved from a single piece of shale, its surface smeared with venom drawn from the tongue of a desert serpent.  The venom never dries, giving the sword an unhealthy sheen.  \r\n\r\nThis short sword is an evil weapon, said to have caused many lingering deaths over the years.  Its name comes from its last known owner, an infamous buccaneer named Letto who preyed on ships traveling upon the Sea of Moving Ice.  It is said that he was caught by the Tribe of the Great Whale in the shadow of Hehnhold's Iceberg, where his ship was hacked apart by the barbarians' great axes and the crew set aflame with burning pitch.  When the battle was over, only driftwood remained.  One of the pieces of his ship's hull found its way south and the wood was used in the construction of one of the rooms in the upper story of the Weeping Widow Inn.  The short sword has been buried within the timber for almost thirty or more years, waiting for someone to find it again and use it in Letto's name.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS:\r\n\r\nDamage:  1d6 + 1, +2 vs. Good Creatures\r\nAttack Bonus:  +1, +2 vs. Good Creatures\r\nEnchantment:  +1\r\nDamage Type:  slashing\r\nSpecial:  10% Chance of Poisoning Target, -1 Penalty to Fortitude save When Held\r\nWeight: 3 lb.\r\nFeat Requirement:  Simple Weapon, Small Blade\r\nType:  One-handed",

With the winter rushing in fierce out of the North and all, it must have lit a fire under some young fools' heads, because a band of 'adventurers'... pure-blood southerners, if there ever was... humped their way up through the Spine of the World and into the small fishing village of Easthaven, one of the Ten-Towns down to the south - along Lac Dinneshere.  They kicked up their feet at the Winter's Cradle Tavern, talking of fame and glory and this and that when those empty-headed fools got yanked into helping the local sword, Hrothgar, go on an expedition to the tree town of Kuldahar and see what was amiss... because there was dark things brewing like there always is, which means some fool's got to go plunge his sword into a few hundred beasties to set the matter right.\n\n\"Well, Hrothgar never made it, and neither did most of the expedition - except for this band of newcomers.  They were caught in an avalanche, hear told, and they dragged themselves into Kuldahar like a line of wet cats.  The winter had picked up, though, and the avalanche had sealed off the Pass, so there was no choice for them but to sit under the shade of the great Kuldahar oak and make do with what they could to solve Kuldahar's problems.  They nearly raised the hells themselves, the story goes, though I don't know all the particulars meself.  I heard some talk of tombs, and temples, and volcanoes, and dwarven deeps and severed hands, and ghosts and shades and all manner of horrid things - but in the end, they set things right, and the seasons resumed their normal heartbeat, and all was well... well, except for Kuldahar and Easthaven being a bit shabbier for wear than before, but that didn't last long.\"\n\n\"As most stories go, ye'd figure that'd be the end of it, and I'm sure those Southerners thought as much, too.  But no sooner had they saved the North from one fool evil then another popped up - a bad mix of barbarian blood and something that should have laid to rest at the bottom of Lac Dinneshere, that's what.  Some hide-wearing medicine man from one of the Northern tribes whisked those southerners right out of Kuldahar - walking right on the wind itself, it's said, and he took them to Lonelywood where he told them he'd had some fool vision of them heading off the barbarian invasion that was about to begin, then he left them to it, no doubt leaving them in the middle of town, blinking, with their mouths hanging open in the middle of that ramshackle logging town.\"\n\n\"Well, when put to the test, they didn't fail the North twice, and they sent the barbarians and a whole flock of evil terrors running and stumbled their way back to Lonelywood.  Last word of them was they were camped out at the Whistling Gallows Inn in Lonelywood, wondering whatever had possessed them to leave the Winter's Cradle in the first place, when some halfling showed up, telling them of some old ruined castle where there were riches beyond a king's dreams - all for the taking.\"\n\n\"The next morning, they were gone, no trace of them, just empty rooms and a tale from an old woman's lips.\"",
